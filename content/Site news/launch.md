And... here we go! The site is very much in a draft stage, and I welcome corrections and additions. Comments are turned on below blog posts for now, and my email address is in the sidebar. Please bear with me if *I'm* offline for weeks at a time over the next few months.

Below is the changelog, but first a few words on the origin of this place: the impetus for the site came with my realisation some weeks ago that, on the internet, there is no definitive compilation of interviews, reviews and criticism related to the works of Joanna Newsom. I begun by collecting URLs to relevant items on a Pinboard account (linked in the sidebar). I then teased some threads out of the collection in order to create the pages of this site.
