I am pleased to say that the site finally has a section dedicated to [*Have One On Me*][HOOM]. This leaves *The Milk-Eyed Mender* as the only album not covered here.

Studying the stock of *Have One On Me* in such broad swathes highlighted just how ambitious in scope the album is. The album contains some of Newsom's most complex lyrics and arrangements, as well as some of her simplest -- hence the great variation in the lengths of the pages that I have dedicated to each song. Revisiting *HOOM*-era interviews gave an opportunity to add Newsom's retrospective thoughts on *Ys* to [that album's page][Ys]. No doubt this will make writing a summary of her comments on *The Milk-Eyed Mender* the most arduous of all the albums.

As always, please [contact me][about] with any additions to, mistakes regarding, or clarifications of, the material hosted on this site.
