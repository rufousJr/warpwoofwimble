*What follows is a transcript of an interview Dave Eggers conducted with Joanna Newsom at an event at Nourse Theatre, San Francisco, on May 16th 2016. The event was organised by the San Franciso-based non-profit City Arts & Lectures and was titled "Joanna Newsom: In Conversation with Dave Eggers". The transcript is by no means* verbatim *and has not been proofed -- it is more of a rough reference for the content of the interview. It was made from a broadcast recording, which, sadly, was abridged.*

[*applause*]

DE: We were talking earlier and you revealed that you used to work on Hayes Street in retail and you were an excellent retail advocate, or not so much?

JN: Not so excellent. I was very bad, one of the worst maybe in history.

DE: What was it, you were not, a, uh ... ?

JN: People would come in and try things on and say this thing [that] I guess people say when they wanna be ..., [*wheedling*] "Oh, this is so pretty, I want it, but I have to pay rent this month." And I feel they would say it and want me to say, "Just do it." But I would be like, "That sounds important. You should pay rent."

[*laughter*]

DE: Let's back up and talk about ... so you grew up in Nevada City. Other people from Nevada City here, alright. You probably know these people, right? [*irony*] It's such a big place.

JN: Uh yeah, name yourselves!

DE: And there was music in your house -- your parents were musicians. But not so much records. What was the music going through your house?

JN: They did play records, I just didn't make the choice -- I didn't go to a record store, select a record of my own, buy it, bring it home, put it on and listen to it until I was in my twenties, more or less.

DE: You were paying rent, right? No money for records.

JN: Yeah. But there was a lot of music being played around me.

DE: What was it? Paint a picture of the typical day.

JN: My mom played a lot of classical and a lot of world music; my dad played some very good pop music -- Talking Heads, I remember being played a lot; my brother played some very cool alternative tracks.

DE: But when they would play together -- your dad was a guitarist [...].

JN: My mom, when she was in her teens and early twenties, she was a pretty serious piano player. So she was a classical musician, and my dad played classical guitar for fun, so he wasn't so serious about it.

DE: But both talented [people]. It's in the blood, right? They're doctors, but on the side they happen to be highly skilled classical musicians.

JN: [*laughs*] I think my dad would take issue with that classification.

DE: With the 'talent' part?

JN: I mean, I think he was pretty talented. He was not a serious musician, but my mom played for years.

DE: And were they giving you lessons at a very young age?

JN: No, although I used to lie on the floor under the piano when my mom was playing and listen to her playing classical music when I was really little. But no, I took lessons from teachers outside the house.

DE: Piano first.

JN: Piano first. I really wanted to play harp from about age four, but the local harp teacher, Lisa Strassi Stein, she wanted me to study piano first. I think she was kinda testing my commitment, so I have to go and take piano lessons for a certain number of years. I think she accepted me as a student when I was eight. I had a to keep ritualistically coming back and asking again for her to teach me.

DE: What was it about the instrument, do you remember?

JN: I don't remember. I just remember that I saw it and knew it was my instrument. And I was kinda a flakey kid, like I would get into things and change my mind, in general, but the one thing I never flaked on was harp. I just loved it immediately and have loved it ever since.

DE: When I think you were about ten, you went to a camp called, is it 'Lark Camp', or 'Lark in the Morning Camp'?

JN: It was then 'Lark in the Morning Music Camp' and I think now it's just 'Lark Camp'.

DE: And this was for musical kids. There would be all kinds of different instruments [...] the Galician ... what is it?

JN: It was not actually for kids; it was all ages. I went with my mom and I don't think you could go just as a kid.

DE: Everybody camps out together?

JN: There [are] cabins. It's in the Mendocino [CA] woodlands. [...] It's pretty basic, basically camping and music from around the world, folk music and classes -- dance classes. It's wonderful.

DE: There was a teacher there, what was her name?

JN: Diana Stork.

DE: ... and this was I think key in terms of developing your polyrhythmic tendencies. Can you talk about what she taught you?

JN: Yeah. She taught her students a west African harp figure that she had transposed from the kora to be playable on the harp. It was really hard for me -- I think I was a little older than ten when I learned it, twelve or thirteen. The left hand is this four-beat bass pattern that keeps returning to the fourth finger, which is the lowest finger on the harp
[*sings the four-beat pattern*]

JN: ... and the right hand is this three-beat bass pattern that loops infinitely up. [*sings the three-beat pattern*]

JN: ... and they sorta interlaced. So you play them together, in unison, so you don't get the polyrhythm in the sense that most people think of it. [*taps a third rhythm*]

JN: There's not a groove to it. First you play it in unison and then you play it syncopated so it does it every twenty-four beats. You basically have to break your mind in half to play it, which, as a twelve-year-old, is the greatest gift anyone could have given me -- teaching me to break my mind into two parts. It was a very simple figure, but it took me so long, probably the whole week, to learn it. I would sit by myself [practicing] over and over again, mad, kicking things, not being able to do it. And then, it just clicked in at some point and I feel like I wrote differently ever since then, because my whole sense of metre had shifted.

DE: [Diana Stork] tells this story of you missing meals and you're out in the woods practising on your own. It doesn't sound to me like something you could pick up in a couple days when you're twelve. It's remarkable.

JN: I couldn't [believe it either]. Maybe it has to do with [the fact that] up until that point I was pretty classical-focussed and I think that thinking about music in that way as so physical -- it's not a problem you can solve, mentally, you actually have to make your mind go blank for it to work, which is also a really excellent state to be improvising in and early-stage composing in as well -- that kind of blank, receptive music-space. It was a really good skill to be taught at that age.

DE: When did you first compose something yourself?

JN: I started composing, I mean "composing", immediately, maybe age four, with my piano teacher. I had a series of really great teachers who placed value in the compositional instincts of four-year-olds and five-year-olds.

DE: Do you remember what you ... do you still have any record of these things?

JN: No, although my teacher Anna Gold, my piano teacher, sent me in the mail some music that I had written as a very young child.

DE: [That] she had transcribed?

JN: Well there was a transcribed melody with words over it that I had written about a camel -- a journey. There was a lot of 'bumpety-bump, the camel jumped', that kinda thing. And then with Lisa Stein -- she was really serious about making sure -- I remember my first lesson with her, because she played a very simply left-hand figure, maybe something like 'C chord, A-minor chord, F chord, G chord'. Something really, really simple, but for half an hour. [She] just had me sit there, improvising the right-hand part. And that was immediately a big part of our lessons until I was a strong enough player that I could play both hands on my own -- play a very basic chordal pattern in the left hand in order to learn about improvisation.

-------------------------------

DE: A few years later, you were at Mills College. What were you seeking to study there?

JN: When I went there, I thought I wanted to be a composer. But I didn't know exactly what that meant; I just knew that I wrote music. At that point I didn't sing, I didn't write words, it was just instrumental only. I wrote just for the harp, [...] and the only word I knew to describe that was composition. So I thought I should learn to be a composer.

DE: What were your fellow students into at that point? What was the environment like?

JN: At that moment, I'd say the prevailing theme I was aware of was more conceptual -- a lot of computer-based stuff, a lot of really high-concept stuff, like almost... I remember there were a number of pieces that were blurring the lines between performance art and composition. Like throwing marbles on a grid over the floor and wherever the marbles land, that charts the piece that you are going to compose -- there's an element of randomness, and [hushed tones] 'that randomness is a comment on like ...' [*laughs*]

[*laughter*]

JN: ... which wasn't my scene as much.

DE: [*laughs*] What did they make of you? Were you the only student composing on the harp at that point?

JN: [I'm not sure.] I think that my year I was the only student composing on the harp. It was a smallish school, smallish programme. There were a few other harpists, but at least when I was there I think they were primarily just classical. I don't think there was any harpist there who was a composition major.

JN: It's funny. I think I projected on to them that what they made of me was not entirely positive, but I don't know if that's fair actually. I think if you're in any kind of creative discipline, there's a certain amount of 'going it on your own' that you have to have a sense of. I would go to class and there were certain things, there was sort of this overarching dialogue happening, and the music I was making wasn't engaging with that at all. In retrospect, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.

DE: Yeah, [I agree.] In a way, did that encourage [you?] To some extent, you're self-taught, in terms of your sense of orchestration and all of these different things. Did that make you more self-reliant and [make you] individualise your sound?

JN: Sorta. What happened actually was that I had been working on composition for so many years and I got a little disillusioned and changed my major. First [...] I wanted to do a self-designed major in ethnomusicology focussing on west African music, but that didn't go well. Then I changed to a creative writing major. I think it was really good for me to do that. For a little while and at a certain point I was attempting to write poetry and I noticed that all of my poems were really bad and then I, a little while later, noticed that they all sounded like song lyrics, but there was no music to them. So I realised that what I needed was to take the music I was working on and divorce it from an academic perspective. In a way I needed to feel a little bit alienated by the prevailing conversation happening at school in order for me to do that. So all those things kinda came together. But I actually loved going to Mills. I loved that school. It's a great place.

DE: Well, the creating writing department has always been so strong, and your lyrics are so ... [to audience] I mean, I was trying to get Joanna to read some of her lyrics as poetry tonight, which I think sounded horrifying to you, but I think you are one of the best lyricists that we have. And I don't know how much of that was informed by having that time studying poetry in that formal setting, but there's a discipline there that is, I think, unique [amongst] contemporary lyricists, and there's a density [...] 'cause I think we all appreciate the incredible density and the allusions, and I think that unpacking your lyrics is so much fun. Do you remember when you first fused some of your poetry to a composition?

JN: I don't remember the moment when that happened. It was more like noticing it after the fact in a way. I realised that I was ... when I tried to compose formal compositions, I didn't like them, and when I tried to write short stories, they were horrendous. I kept attempting to create work inside of these forms that didn't [work] -- I couldn't work with them. And I noticed after the fact that I had been writing songs for fun in the middle of that, and that those were actually the only thing that I thought was good.

DE: What was the first song that sounded like a song and that somebody else said, "That's actually a song and you should record that,"?

JN: Umm, I don't think I played anything for anybody for a while. Well actually no, I had a boyfriend who helped me record things at home. There was a song called "Flying a Kite" that I think was my first song.

DE: That was the first one, huh?

JN: I think it was the first song.

DE: That's still findable. That's easy to ...

JN: Still findable but not recommended.

[*laughter*]

--------------------

DE: That's great. Well it wasn't long until you were recording for Drag City [for] a real album. Were you surprised at how quickly that came about?

JN: Yes.

DE: Did it give you the impetus to create a whole album? Did you already have a catalogue of songs that you were choosing from?

JN: I kinda did. I think probably that first record, if I remember correctly, I probably had at least half ... half of it I pulled from things I had made home recordings [of]. At least half I pulled from pre-existing demos and then maybe half or just under that I wrote new for the proper release.

DE: And the first time you played these songs live, do you remember? Again, when we first heard your music it really didn't have a precedent, and I think it is very hard to compare it to anything, or say, "Oh, it's in the tradition of ... ." At least for me, as an ignoramus, I didn't see any precedent, and that's what drew me to it and I think [drew] so many people. But then again, you're there live, maybe at a festival, and you do come out with a harp, and it does have an unprecedented level, do you remember that early conversation with audiences?

JN: Well let's see. When I first went to Mills, I dropped out briefly. I was there for six months -- a semester -- and then I dropped out for a year and went back to Nevada City. I had this big plan where I was going to compose on my own, but really all I did was work at a coffee shop. During that time, my friend Adam Klein, who has a band called Golden Shoulders -- I was his roommate -- he wanted me to play keyboards with him. So I was doing local shows, playing keyboards with them, and then every once in a while I would stick in, he would have me sing, one of my songs in the middle of the set. I'm pretty sure that was the first time I ever played my songs in front of everybody. It definitely was a vibe-changer, for better or for worse. [*laughs*] You know, he's great, he has this wonderful, kinda pop-py songs, very creative and awesome and then I sounded the way I sounded when I first started out.

DE: But then you would lug out the harp.

JN: Actually, in the very beginning, I think I was just playing keyboard and singing, yeah I didn't lug out the harp. I don't remember the first time I played a harp live and sang. I don't remember how that went; I just blacked out for two years.

DE: Can you talk about the songwriting process now? So what comes first, is it a melody, is it a phrase?

JN: Usually it's a melody with skeletal chords underneath it, blocky. Sort of like if you were slowly forgetting a song bit by bit, then the last thing you would remember is usually the first thing I write. The melody that would get stuck in your head.

DE: Alright. And then what?

JN: Well usually I kinda know what the song's about. It's not a concept, it's just I'm just singing it and I'm conscious of what it's about, so I just have to plug in the words and then I'll usually plug in another. It really depends  on the song. I have certain songs that have written themselves in that wonderful way that occasionally happens, and then I have other ones that I'll work on for three years.

DE: When you know what it's about, is it more of a feeling? Like, "This song is about despair, this song is about leaving, this song is about love,"? I mean, is it that kinda general or is it more ...?

JN: Sometimes. Sometimes it's more specific. And sometimes the thing that it's about carries with it a certain set of extra obligations that make the lyric-writing process more complicated or drawn out.

DE: [In order to] try to get it right. To match the feeling.

JN: Yeah. To match the feeling or the actual subject matter. You know, if a song -- the easiest example would be on the last record, if it was a song like "Sapokanikan", which talks about layering, layering, layering, and is just full of puns and stuff -- I knew what I wanted to write about, but I had to wait for a version of that song to resolve into existence, where each line would mean maybe four or five things, because that's what the song was about, so I knew the formal structure to reflect that, and then other songs can just be a nice clean line.

----------------------------

DE: Let's talk about that song, which every time I hear it I can never say the word again, 'Sapokanikan'?

JN: None of us can say it.

[*laughter*]

DE: So this was an early Native American word for the area that is now the West Village [NYC], right?

JN: Yeah, it means 'tobacco field' and it was the name for the piece of land that became Washington Square Park, which is in the West Village.

DE: And when did you come upon this reference, in a book?

JN: I came upon it while I was researching the history of Greenwich Village.

DE: [*irony*] Which you do. Which one does.

JN: [*laughs*] I did, yeah. I knew what I wanted to write a song about, and I also -- I guess as a side-note in talking about that process -- I do also strongly believe in the magic of words, and the ... like I felt like that song really wanted to exist, like I was trying to collect everything that it needed to exist. And it took me a couple years actually, that particular one did.

DE: How much different did it end up sounding? This is a very epic song, it starts in one place and ends I think way up here, and I love the progression of it; it hits this sort of operatic place at the end. Did it meet your conception of it in the end? Do you solve a problem in a different shape to [how you first conceived it]?

JN: Yeah, that one ... I'm kind of a jock about songwriting, like with that song when I found the right words I was like, "Yeah!" Running around the house, cussing, and kicking things. [laughs]

JN: But then, what you're talking about, that operatic stuff at the end, that was more a fun ... that was just playing around in the studio after the song was written, that was mix, overdubs. That whole record, I wanted all the harmonies to be sung by me rather than other people because there's a lot of references to time-loops on the album, and things repeating and repeating and repeating. I liked the idea of a version of me coming from a parallel universe to sing harmony on this song. That's what that part's about.

DE: Not the jock version, but a different, parallel [one].

JN: The jock version, that's just me, that's the real me.

DE: [*laughs*] And the rest of the album, this theme of time -- I feel like there's some loss there, there's some leaving, there's departures -- early on, do you see the whole album pretty much a certain shape? Do you make one song first and then add one, or...?

JN: This was the first album where I did see it ... the previous one, there was a shape to it, there was a loose governing idea, but I wouldn't call it a concept exactly, I mean none of us ever want to call anything a concept.

DE: Yeah, once you say it, you never escape it.

JN: But you know, if you're ever going to use that horrible word, it would be for that album. I had an idea in my mind of the album I wanted to make and the question I wanted to ask with it and circle back and try to answer with it (I mean answer for myself).

DE: And is that a question you're willing to, uh ... ?

JN: Well, I mean, you know, [*mock condescension*] 'what's the point?' [*laughs*] That's the question of that album. Why are we? And when time ... knowing that whatever we're doing gets extinguished by time. Yeah.

DE: But in a way that's liberating, right?

JN: For me, yeah.

DE: I feel like the answer in the album is in the affirmative, right?

JN: Yes.

DE: Or at least that's how ... even making the music in the first place is an affirmation, right?

JN: Yeah. Yeah, for me. I think one of the prompts for that record was an imaginary someone just finding out that we die. You know what I mean? Imagine if you didn't know, and someone just told you that that's included in the experience of life. And you do know about all the great stuff, and you just get delivered that news ... sort of processing it, and ... I don't know. I'm very inarticulate when I talk about this stuff, because I do think that's the only reason music really exists: to articulate things that we can't.

DE: Well, I think that you've said that you are asking a question and I do hope you can answer with the music. Why you create things is to try and answer these questions. You have talked about certain songs and albums covering or maybe sublimating certain periods in your life. How much of it is a self-healing and a self-exploration, and when does it cross over into, "I'm going to present what I've found in a form that is music." Or is palatable in some way, as opposed to marbles going into holes.

JN: Well it's kinda always (just as a functional device), it's always the former. It's not useful for me to write thinking that I'm writing for anybody else. I think I would write really badly if I was like [*theatrically clears throat*] writing while aware of the fact that at some point in time another human would hear that song. I do know that on some level, but I try to shut off the part of my brain that is conscious of the phase of the record-making process at which it becomes a product that can be purchased and listened to. It's better for me, I write better I think, if I pretend that it's a post-apocalyptic world and I'm writing in a bomb shelter and no-one will ever hear it.

------------------

DE: But you've collaborated with some interesting people.

JN: I have, but not until I'm done writing.

DE: Oh yeah. And what do you look for? Van Dyke Parks was a major collaborator, and Nico Muhly, and David Longstreth. When you choose a collaborator, get involved, what are you looking for? Something specific, a sound that they bring, or are you looking for whatever organic thing happens in the chemistry when you guys sit together?

JN: It kinds depends on the record. Like, for the last record, all the songs ... I thought of the songs on *Divers* as each running a leg of a relay, that, if it were retraced, would describe, in relief, the shape of what the album was about. There was a sameness there, a linear quality where each of them is taking the baton from the preceding one. 'Cause I wrote the whole album knowing the sequence of the songs; there really is a 'this, then this, then this, then this, then this', and there's a through line and a narrative continuity, and there's also a harmonic thing that connects each song: the last note of each song has a particular harmonic relationship with the next note of the following song, and so I knew that I wanted the instrumentation and the arrangements that are overlaid on the songs to have a distinct, differentness -- to have not just a difference of instrumental quality, not just, 'there's a violin on this song, there's a cello on this song', and not just have a difference in performance personality, like, 'there's a violinist on this song, and a *different* violinist on this song', but I wanted there to be a fundamental character difference, where they feel like different vignettes. And I felt like one way to achieve that would be to have different compositional voices overlaid to contrast against the thing that connects all the songs to each other.

JN: So that was this record. With *Ys*, when I collaborated with Van Dyke Parks, I actually kinda wanted the opposite. I wanted something that connected all the songs. I was a huge fan of his, I *am* a huge fan of his, and it was just an instinct. I was a big fan of ... he has a record called *Song Cycle* [that] he wrote when he was twenty-two, and wrote it in part to cope with some sorrow and loss -- and I wrote that record under similar circumstances at the same age and it felt very ... for some reason I felt very drawn to asking him. I tracked him down through my label; I didn't know him at all, and I didn't know anybody who knew him. To his eternal credit, he was like, "Okay. Let's make a record."

DE: That was your first major collaboration with somebody of this stature, I think, and he's an older fellow than you were. How do you keep your vision, I guess, the sound that you want when you have this guy who has a very powerful idea of sound himself?

JN: As the years have passed, I've realised what a unique working arrangement I had with Van Dyke. I don't think it's his normal working arrangement. I don't know why he decided to consent to my particular way of working. I just gave a lot of notes -- months and months and months of notes, back and forth and back and forth -- and then there was another phase, a mixing phase, where there was more editing.

JN: I think part of the way I make sure I don't lose my own voice is I have a rule where no-one is in the room for one thing. So if I work with someone on arrangement, they can't be in the room when I mix. If I work with someone on recording, they can't be in the room when I mix. There's no person who has their hand in more than one pot except for me. So for this last record, which took me five years to make, there were people who did something five years ago: that's what they did, five years ago; and there were some people who came in at the very end.

DE: That's smart.

JN: Thanks. [laughs]

DE: I'm taking notes. That's very good.

----------------------

DE: I wanna go back to .. you said your voice ... your singing has changed over the years, and I think it's one of the things that, when we're first drawn to your work, it's noticeable and distinct. And I think it's so strong. Then some of the things you're doing on *Divers* are brand-new, I feel like. Before *Have One On Me*, you had vocal nodes and had to work with a coach. Can you talk about that progression of your singing? Because I think it came after your musicianship.

JN: Well when I made the first record, I basically hadn't sung at all. I went from never singing before to making a record. That was a weird experiment. Then between that record and the next one, *Ys*, I did a lot of touring, so I think my voice developed in the most basic, human way -- the way like if you lift a bunch of logs, your biceps will develop, but maybe you lift them weird, where you're getting a back injury because no-one ever taught you how to lift them, but you have undeniably stronger arms -- I had an undeniably stronger voice, but it developed in a weird way and I didn't realise I was hurting myself. And around the time of recording the next record, *Have One On Me*, I tried singing one day -- I was up in Weed, California, at the Weed Palace, trying to sing -- and it sounded like opening a can of soda pop. It was just like a pop and a hiss and that was all that came out. It was really scary. I went to a doctor and I had vocal chord nodes. He recommended surgery but I was very scared to have surgery because I'd heard lots of horror stories about scar tissue permanently taking away your ability to sing. So I decided to do voice rest for a few months intead. I just walked around with a button saying that I can't talk.

DE: And a chalkboard?

JN: I actually had a dry-erase board. It was really annoying because I was still living in Nevada City, where there's a lot of street art and busking and everybody thought I was doing an art project.

[*laughter*]

JN: And then I changed the wording on my button and everybody thought I had a horrible disease. 

[*more laughter*]

JN: I didn't know how to get it right, where people would just know that I can't talk for exactly two months, it's not an art project, but I'm also not dying.

DE: A bunch of buttons. And footnotes.

JN: ... but after that, I saw a vocal coach, who taught me basically warm-ups, just vocal warm-ups. And the big difference, the only big difference from that point onward is that I always do vocal warm-ups before every sound-check and before every rehearsal and before every show, for half an hour. And that just ... I gained over an octave actually, I gained I think five notes on top and six notes on the bottom, just from warming up my voice every day. It just completely changed. I had never treated my voice with the same hygiene that I treat my instrument, my harp. I have always approached that harp as a classical musician even when I don't play classically. But I never approached singing the same way, and as soon as I shifted my habits I got to be, I think, a better singer.

DE: Yeah, well your singing is more an instrument now than I think it used to be. Would you agree?

JN: Yeah.

DE: I mean, can you include it in your composing process in a different way than you used to?

JN: Yeah, definitely, yeah.

DE: Oh, that's it? Alright. I got it right. Just check it off, alright.

JN: [*irony*] I think we can go home.

---------------------------------

DE: I wanna talk about narrative in your writing. I'm a huge fan of narrative songwriting -- a song that starts somewhere and tells a story and ends in a different place. You're one of the few practitioners of it that I can think of *now*. There was a time maybe, the Edmund Fitzgeralds and whatever, it sort of waned a little bit every decade and now it feels like you're resurrecting it a little bit. What are your influences? Were there lyricists that influenced you songwriting, influenced your narrative that you're trying to ... ?

JN: Not consciously. I mean, I'm sure I'm influenced by lots of people that I like, but I can't think offhand of a songwriter, or a writer in general, whose work I read and thought, "That's what I want to do." In fact, many of my favourite writers are stylistically very different from the style that I write in. So I don't know.

DE: Who do you like? Are there writers -- books, poets -- that you read and that you have to ... I have certain authors that if I'm reading them, I have to have a notebook nearby, because I just get inspired. It has nothing to do with ... it's just something electric on the page that makes me want to write. Are there people that ... ?

JN: Yeah... I mean, I don't know what this says about my brain, but it used to be the case much more. When I was in my early twenties, I was a real margin-writer. Every book I would write in. I don't know if I've lost a little bit of my curiosity, or something, or if I'm just not as industrious, or what it is

JN: But certainly I think a massive influence for me (I can say influence here, because I was conscious of it) would be Nabokov.

DE: *Pale Fire*, you've mentioned [as being] an influential book.

JN: Well *Lolita* actually was the biggest one for me. Not in terms of content but in terms of writing. I did a whole essay at Mills about the treatment of the colour mauve[^mauve] in *Lolita*. He is one of those writers in whom it is safe to invest your complete and utter trust and confidence, because every word has been chosen for a reason. You can read with complete abandon in that sense -- every single word is like this polished, hewn selection that's placed, not only chosen perfectly but chosen perfectly with relation to the one that precedes it and the one that follows it, and also this thing that's gonna happen in two hundred pages that will force you, through some other turn of phrase, to recall its previous use and feel differently about the narrative because of it.

[^mauve]: One wonders if Newsom was aware at the time of Nabokov's clarification to Alfred Appel Jr. on the subject of "Symbols and colors" in *Lolita*, which the latter described as "one of the most significant statements Nabokov made about his own art" and which goes, in part:
> There exist novelists and poets, and ecclesiastic writers, who deliberately use color terms, or numbers, in a strictly symbolic sense. The type of writer I am, half-painter, half-naturalist, finds the use of symbols hateful because it substitutes a dead general idea for a live specific impression. I am therefore puzzled and distressed by the significance you lend to the general idea of "red" in my book. When the intellect limits itself to the general notion, or primitive notion, of a certain color it deprives the senses of its shades. [...] I think your students, your readers, should be taught to *see* things, to discriminate between visual shades as the author does, and not to lump them under such arbitrary labels as "red". [...]

DE: And every page, you don't ... that's one of my books, that I have next to me all the time. But you can pick up any page and read it divorced from the plot, and it's still one of the prettiest pieces of writing you've ever read and it has nothing to do with what's going on or whatever, it's just the use of language. That book took five years to write.

JN: I didn't know that.

DE: *Divers* also took five years in the making.

JN: [*irony*] So they're the same.

[laughter]

DE: There you go. [*irony*] I'm assuming that's what you meant, that the two are on par. So this took five years in the making. Was that a process of layering? How much is it getting something recorded, going back to it, letting it sit; or how much of it was a real five years of grinding at the same, you know, every day on the same ... ?

JN: I think it was roughly a slowed-down version of what has historically been my normal process, which would be: writing; recording; mixing. But for me it just took three and a half years to write, and then a year and a half to record, and then a year and a half to mix. I got really intensely involved in the mix this time, and I took things home and I spent months thinking about them. And because I worked with so many different arrangers on the various songs on this one, I was having a lot of the same early conversations, like there was a lot of repeated explaining things in a new way in order to meet a new person in the middle. It was a lot of explaining [what] the album as a whole was trying to convey, and what I wanted to project, and so forth. Whereas if I had worked with one collaborator, I probably would only have had to have that conversation one time.

DE: Right. And over the period of five years, do you always know where you're at? Do you always feel like you're on the same road going to the same destination? Are there periods where you think, "Boy, this has been three and a half years, and, I don't know. This might not be what I think it is here. It might not get there."?

JN: I claim now that, yes, I felt super-great about it the whole time. I think there are people in my life who would laugh at that and say it's not true. But right, when I look back, it's just been this wonderful five years of knowing what I wanted to do at every turn. (Probably not true.)

DE: Speaking of questions from the audience, this is the time when the lights will come up a little bit and you have the opportunity to ask a question. There'll be microphones roaming through the aisles, so raise your hand. There's Kay over there, there's Hannah.

Runner: This question is towards your left, in the front of the orchestra.

Q1: Hi. There were a lot of questions about collaborations, and that just made me think about your collaborations with one of my other favourite artists, Paul Thomas Anderson, and I was wondering how that came to be? -- if he approached you saying, "I think you'd be perfect for this part," or if you had some sort of working relationship before that? Just speaking on that experience.

JN: He kind of ... I'm not sure how much he knew that he actually wanted me to do ... (this is a movie called *Inherent Vice* by Paul Thomas Anderson)

[*applause*]

JN: Thank you. ... that I was the narrator of. Originally, I had just known him through friends, and he had asked me if I would record some fragments of narrations, which were just Thomas Pynchon, basically just passages from the book (also called *Inherent Vice*). And he asked me if I would record them into my phone and send them back to him. Whatever his plan was at that point, my understanding was that he was testing out the idea of having a narrator, and was asking his pal to record those parts, but that I wasn't actually a person he was considering using for the movie -- that he was blocking out -- he needed a female voice, to block stuff out while he planned how he wanted to make the movie. He didn't really follow up on that at all, and then months later I got a call from Warner Brothers wanting my measurements. That was how he asked me to be in the movie.

[*laughter*]

JN: But you know, he does things in his own way. So I don't know if he knew from the beginning and was just thinking it through, or decided on a whim.

DE: What did you think of the process? It's unlike anything else: there's a lot of downtime. It's ninety-five percent downtime if you're acting in a movie, right?

JN: Yes, although I didn't act a whole lot in it. I was only on set for, like, four days.

DE: Oh that's it? Okay.

JN: Really small on-camera time, and within that I didn't have a lot of downtime, just because I wasn't in the movie a whole lot. The voiceover stuff was kinda fun because I would just come and do it over and over again. He would try something out, and then re-phrase it slightly and want me to come back and do it again. Or he had a fragment of narration in mind that he knew that he wanted and then once he had edited the scene together the way he wanted it he realised that the particular swing of the narration and the place that it reached its dramatic peak didn't coincide any more with the arc of the scene so he wanted me to come re-record it in a way that sorta lined up more with the contour of the scene. So it was really interesting to watch the reasons that different takes worked or didn't work for him or for the movie. I know nothing about film. I knew nothing about film then and I still know nothing about film, but it was kind of exciting just to see someone else's process.

DE: Well you also collaborated with the other, I think similar, icons of film, the Muppets.

JN: Yeah yeah yeah.

[*laughter throughout*]

JN: Yeah. That was really funny. That doesn't go away. But I really didn't do anything. I went into some random studio and recorded one line. I guess there was Zach Galifanakis (actor) -- he himself did a very brief cameo in  *The Muppets Movie* song, where he sang one line, and his stipulation for singing that one line was that he wanted me to actually be the voice that came out of his mouth. So it was like a two-part extremely random cameo that definitely would have gone unrecognised if they hadn't credited me. But it is, I believe, the one thing I have done musically that is on Spotify.

---------------------

Q2: Hi. I think my question kind of ties into his [Q2] a little bit. I'm wondering about how you push yourself as an artist, or understand the difference between, "Oh, I'm staying in my comfort zone," versus ... when do you know when you're pushing yourself? And when do you know when you're still staying in your comfort zone?

JN: I think the classic thing of not noticing time has passed, and having forgotten to eat, and smelling weird. Like, "I haven't showered in a day," (sorry). You know, this thing where you kinda disappear into the process. That's usually when I know that something is good. I also would like to work out a better system, because when a song's not working, sometimes I just won't work on a song, for a month or two months or three months, and just look at antiques on the internet.

[*laughter*]

JN: So that's usually when I ... when I don't like something, it makes me angry at it, and I walk away from it. And then, slowly, it'll start to make sense to me at some point and then I'll go back to it and nothing else exists for me other than that thing for the duration. But I think that that scares me a little bit, because the more busy and challenging and demanding life gets, the less you can follow those whims and ignore, or attend to, instincts based on that sort of level of whether it's fun and working or not fun and working.

JN: I really respect and admire artists who get up in the morning and put their timecard in and put on a tie, and, like, work in that way. Maybe that's a good goal to have.

-----------------------

Runner: This question is upstairs, in the [?] at the centre.

Q3: Hello. My question is about the album artwork. I think particularly for *Divers* -- if I close my eyes and try to dream up the album artwork for that album, I couldn't think of anything better than what was selected. So I'm wondering, do you seek out artists? And how that collaboration works, do you have specific requests?

JN: Well for that record, it was a case of sychronicity a little bit. The artist is named Kim Keever who did the landscape photos, and the artist who did the portraiture on that record is Annabel Mehran, who is sort of my artistic lifetime collaborator in terms of helping determine what the narrator of the album looks like. 'Cause she has an incredibly intuitive way of understanding the kind of record I'm trying to make, and visualising and talking with me and helping me figure out how to make the spirit of that record have a face and have an environment -- in a way maybe that will enhance the whole world. Bring light, um, bring [*mock condescension*] verisimilitude.

JN: But the Kim Keever work ... I had walked past the gallery in New York pretty early on while I was working on the album and writing, and fell in love with one of his pieces, which ended up being the cover of the record. I would come and look at it every couple days, and I really wanted it -- I wanted it in my home, and I couldn't bring myself to make that decision and actually bring it home and hang it on the wall because it was so agitating to me, like, looking at it made me fidgety and I knew if I put it on my wall I would have trouble sleeping. It would be like having a house right over the ocean or something, where there is this constant emotional churning happening, or you drink eighteen cups of coffee or something. That's how looking at that piece made me feel. And I realised few years into working on the record that the quality of agitation that that piece made me feel was very similar to the agitation that I was trying to narrate, or abate, or counter in some way with the songs -- with the themes of the record. Towards the end of having written those songs, I at one point went back to the gallery and looked at the piece again and felt differently about it, like something had shifted for me. I realised at that point that I really wanted to get in touch with Kim about collaborating on the artwork for the record because I felt like it was intimately tied for me with the world I was trying to describe. There's a very similar 'zoomed-out' quality -- he does a lot of landscapes and they're either post-apocalyptic or pre-human in some way. They're conspicuously devoid of any sign of humanity and I felt very connected to that. The record felt very connected to that in some way. That's a whole other spiel.

Q4: Hi Joanna, thanks for being here.

JN: Thank you.

Q4: I'm about to start my first year as an elementary-school teacher.

[*applause*]

Q4: Thank you. I was really struck by this story of learning that first syncopated rhythm at camp, and especially [by] what you said about having to break your mind in half in order to play it. And I don't know, I read that as both literally and figuratively, and I was hoping you could talk more about the teachers that you've had in your life, that have brought you to that point, where you feel you can break your mind in half.

JN: I've had some unbelievably important teachers. That particular lesson, that specific one, Diana Stork, that was huge for me. But there are other teachers I've had who've taught me equally huge lessons. I had a teacher in high school, Mrs. Parker, who basically taught me how to read. Re-taught me how to read. I don't know how else to explain it. But I wanted so badly to see what she was seeing in any given line, and she was such an excellent teacher. And I've had other teachers who made me re-think other elements of writing or of reading. It's not a very articulate answer, but I think it's crazy sometimes to think about how ... I don't know if this is true for everyone, maybe some people are truly self-... just have created their own identity in a very pure, self-generated way, but I, I have been the beneficiary of so many incredible teachers over the years.

DE: I think we're so lucky to have Joanna here as a Californian. You'll have to come back. But let's give Joanna a round of applause for everything she has ...
