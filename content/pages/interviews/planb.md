Title: Plan B magazine features
Status: hidden

The now-defunct music magazine, Plan B, featured Joanna Newsom in issue #0.5, published November 2004. The entire run of the magazine was distributed in PDF form by Everett True, one of the editors, some years after the magazine closed down. A mirror of the #0.5 PDF is now hosted [here]({filename}/pdfs/planb-issue0.5.pdf), and a web-native version can be found below.

The feature consisted of two parts: a review of a gig at the Komedia, Brighton; and a lengthy interview conducted in Hyde Park.

# Pastoral Splendor: Joanna Newsom live #

**Joanna Newsom**  
*Komedia, Brighton*

The girls are chattering, talking in hushed whispers: "God, but she’s so *beautiful*." Yeah, but it’s a strange idyll of beauty, so Southern USA, so *Gone With The Wind*, so delicate, both womanly and childlike. It’s divorced of artifice and purpose, existing neither to impress nor to corrupt but of itself. It’s that rarest of beauty: feminine, one that other women, in particular, appreciate and admire. (Men are much more base.)

The lights are darkened: no fancy light show here, no flashing amber and grey, no smoke clouds pluming and curling up to the ceiling, just a lady in a summer dress cajoling and plucking at a harp that dwarfs her petite frame. Just a smile and a wide open mouth, words tumbling and top-tailing one after another, sometimes astonished, often playful, always charming. There's just Joanna Newsom and her Nevada City vision of life and romance and boughs and ghostly places: ice cream churns exposed and heavy on the travail, taking up an entire porch on a lazy summer's evening, cities made out
of hay and friendship, the plumage of a male peacock vibrating.

There's no lights, no between-song chatter -- just a black ether where strangers, unfamiliar with the work of this ethereal harpist, applaud reverently, taken off-guard by such pure, ragged-sweet grace. Well, not everyone...

"I didn’t come here tonight," remarks one cruel boy to another in the toilets, "to hear someone sing like a thalidomide child."

Man. These evocative, homespun stories of Joanna Newsom are many things: rambling, beguiling, full of a naïve joy at the absurdities and wonderment of life, backed with a solitary harp. And not even that, for the first song, when Joanna stands stage-front and reduces a throbbing Komedia to silence with an a cappella, shouted lament that baffles and excites simultaneously. But impeded by fate? No fucking way. That's like saying Tom Waits can't sing.

A whole other world opens as you immerse yourself in Joanna's music and her 2004 album, *The Milk-Eyed Mender*, a world of "*rough, straggly sage*", "*palaces and storm clouds*" ('En Gallop'). She’s hardly been stifled from birth: quite clearly, the opposite holds true -- Joanna is one of those privileged few given the space and time to develop and to breathe freely. If her music and folksy way of singing and harp-playing sometimes seem to hark back to 'simpler' times (which were never simpler, of course, just more brutal and uncaring), it's because she genuinely seems to have sidestepped much of the bullshit and detritus of modern day society.

As with her mentor, Will Oldham (who discovered Joanna from a cassette she made of her Appalachian folk/bluegrass-influenced music), you feel immensely privileged to be privy to such secret delights. Unlike Mr Oldham, however, Joanna never lingers too long in sorrow. There's too much to be discovered: too many whalebones and molluscs and pies to mull over and enjoy.

Sure, if you want to be cynical of innocence, you could wilfully misinterpret Joanna's way of enunciating certain syllables as childlike, retarded even. But unlike, say, CocoRosie's studiously art-laden mysteries (their beguiling 2003 album *La Maison De La Rêve* is a superficially close parallel), you never get the impression that this is a temporary phase Joanna is going through. And, unlike Will Oldham himself, you never feel this is an act. This is pure Joanna: harp and all.

Also. Step back a second. Ignore the voice. Concentrate on the harp. Concentrate on the magic (with a 'k' if anyone’s taking notes – and
someone should) of songs like 'The Sprout And The Bean' and 'The Book Of Right-On': tumbling, febrile, hypnotic, assured, making full use of both range and silence.

What I know about harp-playing could be written on the tiniest string of Nicanor Zabaleta's cast-offs, but this is incredible. I hold no truck with specialists or virtuosity, goodness knows, but Joanna makes her harp *sing* in disparate pastoral splendour. Creative, alert, alive, always looking for a fresh way of explaining. Again, it's her childlike playfulness and curiosity that is her greatest asset. She plays the harp like a troubadour, but never once forgets how special the gift of music is.

You could lose yourself in Joanna's stories for an eternity. She transports the listener into a world far from mundane Brighton rain and the shouts of lads on the streets outside. And yet you know that, through Joanna's eyes, those very streets and shouts themselves would turn into something magical, possessed. This is her gift: the gift of transport and delight. This is the ability to put across her *other vision*.
The girls whisper, excitedly, about the harp, the voice... but most of all, the untrammelled beauty.

And the boys?

The boys keep quiet, for fear of exposing themselves.

The little house -- a park-keeper's lodge -- stands at the Lancaster Gate entrance of Hyde Park. It's a Gothic-revival charm of pointed gables and sugary stone twists and leaded windowpanes. We are moving towards it dreamily in the hot late-summer afternoon. It's no wonder that the girl in the thrift-store prairie princess dress and high-heeled brown leather dancing shoes is drawn to it. It's the house an observant songwriter/harpist could surely live in: with the rolling park and squirrels and fountains on the one side, the busy city on the other side, and (no doubt) myriad little rooms and low lintels and old wooden cabinets on the inside.

"That kind of house could make me cry if I was in the right mood," says Joanna Newsom, as we settle in the shade of a chestnut tree.

### Tales to tell, tears to shed ###

I've cried to the music of Joanna Newsom: once on a rainy station platform; once, early one morning, derailed by a confounding muse; once at a crowded club, watching her play with a delicate muscularity and discipline that stunned the audience into confused and respectful silence. It is not that her music is sad – although sometimes it may well be. The tears were more those strange tears induced by the perfect symmetry of a perfect song played perfectly. The happy-sadness brought on that sweet, snagging feeling of the past linking hands with the present, the 'real' with the imaginary, and all your little stories with the collective big stories.


When something strange and beautiful fills your soul a little too quickly, the leftover beauty has to drain away somewhere.

At 22 years old, with a debut album slowly and surely becoming a 'classic', an unusual instrument she plays both distinctively and beautifully, and a voice that perplexes and beguiles in equal measure, it makes perfect sense that Joanna Newsom should have become a new kind of folk heroine, photographed against backdrops of trees and fields like a dryad in cowgirl boots, plucking out spells and lullabies on 46 thrumming strings. We love our fairytales. Yet, despite the immediate, unarguable emotional impact of Newsom's songs, and the immediate, unarguable charm and loveliness of Newsom herself, it doesn’t hurt to question what it means to have your art and craft and life embroidered such; what it means to be cast in the role of *naif*, of pixie, of child-woman. I wonder if a fairytale is the right kind of story to be spinning when the prosaic, rough reality of folk music is equal in importance to its whimsical beauty, and when Joanna
Newsom's well-documented story -- while rich enough in esoteric detail to satisfy the most legend-hungry listener -- is also a story of hard work, scholarship and an intensely thoughtful and intelligent young woman.

Growing up in Nevada City -- twinned with Bodmin in Cornwall, she tells me within minutes of our meeting (much to my delight) -- she began studying the harp around the age of nine. Hers was a nurturing, creative environment, within both the family and the community in
general. It evidently fostered the love and confidence in writing her own music that took her to Oakland liberal arts school Mills College and its acclaimed composition course. But, upon realising there was "no place for songwriting" in contemporary composition ("there's a sense that everyone does everything at the same time and then they move onto the next thing"), Newsom switched majors and left to concentrate on her own material, circulating CDRs among friends.

The trajectory that followed -- Bay Area performances, a tour with Will Oldham, two EPs, and then *The Milk-Eyed Mender*, an album that gathered momentum in my heart so gradually and naturally that I now can't imagine not having a copy -- can be read about elsewhere, and will soon be eclipsed by what looks set to be a busy, strange few years for Newsom, as she navigates the inevitable mainstream success.

In September, she's supporting Neil Young in Berkeley, at a benefit concert for local arts centres, dance troupes and a radio network. "I am so excited!" she enthuses. "He’s honestly my favourite... I don't know what to follow the word 'favourite' with... singer, songwriter, pop star, rock musician? He is very special to me. I associate him with really good conversations with my dad, because I talk to my dad about music a lot, and he and I have talked about what makes Neil Young so special, and we both agree that he's got the most beautiful voice probably ever in rock music. It's his sense of melody, the way he caresses his voice around his melodies. His voice has the same effect on me as an oboe has, it has a similar timbre -- it's high and kind of rough, but really rich and velvety. It cuts through the music, like
in a symphony when you hear the oboe cutting through everything else."

She goes on to giggle at her first phone conversation with Young; how nervous she felt speaking with him: "You know when you sit around with your friends and talk about, 'Who is the person you'd be the most starstruck to meet?' The top of my 'starstruck' list has
always been Neil Young."

### Frontier ballads ###

It's a good time to be making American folk music: a good time and a bad time. 

Good, because there's a receptiveness both in the US and elsewhere to the countercultural properties of traditional musics, and an interest in the raw, the old, the weird, the magical qualities of close-recorded wood and strings, and the acceptance of lyrics that touch upon archaic, romantic themes.

Good, because performers such as Newsom and her friend Devendra Banhart country-dance their way into our clubs like a couple of shy, flamboyant unicorns, and set up in the corner with those of us who've been squirreling away our charity shop June Tabor records and Shirley Collins box sets and our *Book Of Frontier Ballads* and our *Texas Piano Blues 1927–29*, and show us that the music we love is coming out of real breathing people.

The English equivalents of this have been less arresting -- more about boys with guitars rehashing their teacher parents' Pentangle records and namechecking the goddamn *Wicker Man* than any real attempt to get to the fen-dark, dawn-light heart of this country’s traditional songs -- but the recent welcome given to Banhart and Newsom here bodes well.

But what happens when the hipsters no longer believe in unicorns? Will they just ignore them, or will they actively try to destroy them?What happens when you impose time limits on this timeless music? While Newsom's confident in the progression of her own work, the creation of a 'scene' of which she’s an unwilling member perturbs her. She's read of a 'movement' including herself, Banhart, CocoRosie, Faun Fables and others.

"If there is any commonality, it is the idea of self-containedness in the music, so it seems contradictory to make a movement out of it," she says. "I feel no affinity with a lot of the music that's being lumped in with this movement. With Devendra, it's hard for me to separate
whether I feel close to him musically or just because we've been friends since before either of us was playing music. I'm not shaky on what my sound is. I know it may change over the years, but I know what I'm trying to do. And I can't necessarily lump my sound under a particular label."

### Knitting needles and harp s###

We should not try to categorise Newsom whatsoever, because her music is disconcertingly strange yet as familiar as a museum or a family photograph.

In trying to pin down its strangeness, you fall back on juxtapositions, saying that her voice is both young and old, both beautiful and rough, its instinctiveness juxtaposed with the assured harp playing.

You say that the harp lines contain more juxtapositions -- stylistically, melodically -- as she touches upon minimalism and the beautifully mannered classic songwriting style of, say, early Van Dyke Parks (another Californian 'non-singer' whose subverted classical training sat beautifully with his funny, smart little voice and intricate lyrics), as well as the more obvious folk themes. You say that to play folk music
on a Lyon and Healy harp is itself a little contradictory. Newsom is discovering that reactions to her are equally polarised. This surprises her.

"I feel confident to an extent," she says. "At this point, I'm doing it the way I want to be doing it. But especially now that I'm in England and there's more of a chance that people will just wander into a show and have no idea who I am, there's this recurring fear that people are gonna start throwing things at me! Because of this thing that's been hammered into my head that you either love my music or hate it, which, incidentally, I hadn't even considered when I started playing music. I've had some really violent reactions where people have said, 'That's the worst thing I've ever heard, her voice is horrendous'.

"I think it is a lot more difficult to swallow that kind of rough-edgedness and unruliness in a female voice than in a male voice. But there was a review that came out in an Austin newspaper that said, 'You can only shove a knitting needle down your ear for so long before sweet unconsciousness sets in'. It’s been seared into my memory because it was my first bad review. "I've always known I had a strange
voice, because there has to be some reason I didn't use it for years and years. I think it was an understanding I picked up that I didn't have a voice people wanted to listen to. It wasn't until I was much older -- just two years ago, or so -- that I decided I would use it anyway."

It's the intimacy, I say to her. You don't use any effects and your voice is right *there*, in the listener's ear. But, later, I realise that's not what I mean at all. By 'intimacy', I think I mean the unaffected dramatic momentum and uncompromising directness of all the best folk singing. These features are hard to swallow indeed, unless you're lucky enough to have them speak right to your soul (as Newsom experienced on first hearing a recording of the Virginia-born ballad singer, Texas Gladden). This drama and directness is present in Gladden's ballads, Blind Willie Johnson's fervent fire and brimstone growl; in the lusty Yorkshire laments of the Watersons and in the piping ethereality of Shirley Collins. It's in Newsom's mountainside poetess lilt and Banhart's witchy vibrato -- and it embarrasses the hell out of most of us. Those who love it, meanwhile, can't understand how anyone could fail to.

### Early one morning ###

Many people have a violent antipathy towards folk music in general.

"They do!" she agrees. "I don't know why. Just all of it is so beautiful always to me. It's like comfort food. It's like, when do you not want bread and butter? You can have too much bread and butter, I can listen to too much Texas Gladden and then I have to go listen to silence or some pop music or some Fleetwood Mac, but you always want to start your day out with it."

Another deep strand of influence running through Newsom's music is rooted in the early to mid-20th Century work of composers such as Henry Cowell, Charles Ives and -- Newsom's personal touchstone -- Ruth Crawford Seeger, in asserting a new American musical identity that had little to do with the established European art music tradition.

Newsom's fascination with Seeger is twofold. She obviously relates to the composer's interweaving of folk tunes with theories of dissonance. Less obviously, she's intrigued by Seeger's decision to make her family, rather than her composition, her main life's work. Newsom's empathy with the uneasy relationship between the personal and creative is apparent in her lyrics, which combine a punchy vigour with immaculate rhymes; insomnia, frustration and awkward bodies with palaces, canaries, and constellations.

"I always have a hard time thinking what influences my lyrical style," she states. "I love Nabokov, to a sort of obsessive degree. It's the combination of giftedness with words and stringing them together in the most amazing ways, and also an immense attention to what happens when different words bump up against each other.

"I do choose words very deliberately. Sometimes it's because I like to play with syllabic emphases and where they intersect with the downbeats. Or maybe I like to think of the sung part as a contrapuntal line, so sometimes it'll syncopate with the music and other times it'll be parallel to it. Word choice has a lot to do with the sound of the music, and word length too."

### Yarn and glue ###
To give full prominence to the complexity of both lyrical and musical arrangements, the recording of *The Milk-Eyed Mender* was kept admirably simple. The only multitracking was Newsom's eerie, layered voice that pops out occasionally like an entreating choir -- and this, apparently, was a happy accident. She and her partner and producer Noah Georgeson concentrated instead on recording the harp as effectively as they could, positioning microphones differently for each song: "Creating a kind of self-contained, specific space for each one... that was such a consuming endeavour we didn't feel it was necessary to bring other instruments in. If we could just have the best possible verisimilitude for the harp, and also have this shifting landscape it was inhabiting, that was enough."

The shifting landscape... It's another thing that helps create your own musical world. Your music has its own mythology -- its own folkloric world. Are you interested in folklore and myth?[^miles]

"Absolutely. Something that is really interesting about personal mythology, you know, which every person has, is that we accumulate this collection of symbols. We accumulate a set of associations with objects, and they run deep, and it's a whole lifetime of memories that imbue these objects with enormous symbolic strength. And those symbols appear again and again; these sort of symbolic stutters happen. I keep catching on certain ideas, and I don’t even realise I'm doing it until people quote them back to me and say, 'You talk about bones a lot' or something.

"With the album sleeve, I was specifically thinking of the alchemy of closeness, of all of these enormously loaded, personal things bumping up at the edges, crammed together in this sort of airless, lush, dense collection. It's an embroidered piece that my friend did, and we collected bones and hair and butterflies... everything on there has specific meaning -- all the cloth is from pieces of my mum's dresses.

"I wanted there to be a sense equally of something a child would make for a Mother's Day present, but also of a shrine to someone who's died, like in a lot of Latin American cultures. And then I wanted it to have this sense of something you'd find in an attic or in a thrift store and wonder, what is this, this is like the weirdest thing I've ever seen..."

### Down where I darn... ###

The homespun voodoo of *The Milk-Eyed Mender*'s sleeve, with its owl and aeroplane, spider's web and narwhal motifs, feels like a tribute to the forgotten handiwork that was once so much a part of female experience. Like the music, the artwork is bound together with a traditional sense of craftsmanship.

"It's actually a direct reference to that: the 'Milk-Eyed Mender' is in a line from 'Sadie' which invokes that notion. The line about stitching something: '...Stretched -- on the hoop where I stitch -- this adage / Bless our house and its heart so savage.' You know, when girls used to cross-stitch phrases to hang on the wall. That whole set of lines is full of references to handiwork and sewing and darning."

These things fascinate me, because I can't do them, or I'm really bad at doing them --

"Me too!" she agrees. "Oh, well, I can crochet..."

I can't crochet. But I can cross-stitch. Actually, I'm quite good... It fascinates me as an idea, that there's this world of female art and craft that’s always existed and is very beautiful. But as much as I like to look at it, I’m really glad I don’t have to sit and do it!

She nods: "It stands for all of the things you can't do. Just having a parlour craft, something to while away the hours . Which is actually where the harp got started -- the Western classical harp, obviously: the kind of harp I play started as a parlour instrument for wealthy young girls to play so that they could become accomplished young ladies."

And there you are, I say. Very accomplished.

We both laugh. It's such a pat conclusion. But there's a truth in it, for I'm yet to hear a contemporary interpretation of folk music as female-centred, intellectually rigorous, wryly humorous, instantly iconic, utterly beautiful and, yes, *accomplished* as Joanna Newsom's.

There's no yearning for a prelapsarian time and place (except for the Edens of our imaginations); her music hides uncanny awareness beneath its simplicity. While Newsom might have stopped formal study, she's a natural scholar. And, maybe, a born teacher.

### Song cycles ###

Throughout the middle of the 20th Century, John and Alan Lomax collected folk songs of the United States. Most were songs of struggle; songs of working and living in harsh times.

It would be disingenuous for a young woman of Joanna Newsom's background and personality to take such songs as they are and sing them to us straight. Instead, she narrates different struggles -- albeit she channels the ghosts of the old songs, the old blues. (They're not always her tunes, no, but damn sure they're hers to use.)

Listen, and you'll hear the patterns of a sea-shanty here, and the epic narrative of an old mountain lament there. But Newsom is singing the work songs of our inner worlds -- the dragons that rant and rail and beset us as we find our voices -- and the ballads of her own daydream journeys into self-knowledge.
