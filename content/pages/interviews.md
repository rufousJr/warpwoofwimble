# Key interviews #

There are many interviews and profiles quoted in the 'music' section of this site, but a few of them are well worth reading completely in their own right as they contain a lot of interesting material not necessarily related to a particular album or era.

+   ["Outer Child", East Bay Express, 2003][eastbayexpress]

    This is a very early interview-profile (Milk-Eyed Mender was released in 2004). Newsom is more elliptic and poetic in this one than later interviews, I feel. It is interesting how some of the things she says resonate with images from Ys. As the title might indicate, the author really conjures the image of Newsom as a child-like genius.
	
+   ["'Forty-Six Strings and Some Truths': a conversation with Joanna Newsom", Arthur Magazine 10, April 2004][arthur2004]
    
	A good Q&A covering the early years. Many questions asked in interviews over the years were probably asked for the first time here.
	
+   ["Joanna Newsom by Roy Harper", Bomb Magazine 116, Summer 2011][bombmagazine]
    
	The quality of both the questions and answers are excellent in this interview -- the questions, because they are asked by fellow songwriter Roy Harper; the answers, because they were told by email to a magazine that is more concerned with artistic technique than some more gossipy music magazines. There are many interesting insights here into Newsom's conception of the songwriting process, her relationship with Drag City, and her position on the album. You'll probably learn a bit about Harper from reading it, too!

+   ["Joanna Newsom: Persistence of Vision", Under the Radar 31, Spring 2010][undertheradar]

    This is about the closest thing I've seen to a biography of Newsom, which covers up to the Milk-Eyed Mender era.
