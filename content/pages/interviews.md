# Key interviews #

There are a great number of published interviews with Newsom, which only increased in frequency as her career progressed; the four interviews below represent what I consider to be the ones of most interest to a scholar of Newsom's work, in that they focus on her artistic philosophy and formative experiences and feature many original questions.

+   ["Outer Child", East Bay Express, 2003][eastbayexpress]

    This is a very early interview-profile (Milk-Eyed Mender was released in 2004). Newsom is more elliptic and poetic in this one than later interviews, I feel. It is interesting how some of the things she says resonate with images from Ys. As the title might indicate, the author really conjures the image of Newsom as a child-like genius.
	
+   ["'Forty-Six Strings and Some Truths': a conversation with Joanna Newsom", Arthur Magazine 10, April 2004][arthur2004]
    
	A good Q&A covering the early years. Many questions asked in interviews over the years were probably asked for the first time here.
	
+   ["Joanna Newsom by Roy Harper", Bomb Magazine 116, Summer 2011][bombmagazine]
    
	The quality of both the questions and answers are excellent in this interview -- the questions, because they are asked by fellow songwriter Roy Harper; the answers, because they were told by email to a magazine that is more concerned with artistic technique than some more celebrity-focussed music magazines. There are many interesting insights here into Newsom's conception of the songwriting process, her relationship with Drag City, and her views on the album *qua* album. You'll probably learn a bit about Harper from reading it, too!

+   ["Joanna Newsom: Persistence of Vision", Under the Radar 31, Spring 2010][undertheradar]

    This is about the closest thing I've seen to a biography of Newsom, which covers up to the Milk-Eyed Mender era.
