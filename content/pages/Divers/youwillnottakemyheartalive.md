Title: You Will Not Take My Heart Alive
Release: Divers

<!--!!! epigraph ""
	> In a highway service station  
	> Over the month of June  
	> Was a photograph of the earth  
	> Taken coming back from the moon  
	> And you couldn't see a city  
	> On that marbled bowling ball  
	> Or a forest or a highway  
	> Or me here least of all  
	> You couldn't see these cold water restrooms  
	> Or this baggage overload  
	> Westbound and rolling  
	> Taking refuge in the roads-->
