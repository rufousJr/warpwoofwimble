# Conception #

According to the *New York Times*[^nyt], Newsom described *Divers* as her "most unified album. 'It’s a very dangerous word, but I think it’s maybe the closest I’ve come to a concept record, God help us,' she said." This could be contrasted with earlier albums, such as *Have One On Me*, of which she said, "I didn't have a fully contained vision going in. I didn't have a concept - and it's not a concept record."[^hoomquietus]

# Production #

Newsom took a much larger role in the production of this album, the first for which she was involved in the mixing. The mixing took six months, and the album was mastered eleven times.[^rookie] "I had a really strong opinion about every note, every beat, every word."[^latimes] Several of the production team and musicans on the record have been credited on other Newsom albums too. Newsom mentions the recording process in a *Guardian* interview,[^guardian] and it is covered in great depth in an interview with Stereophile entitled [Joanna Newsom, Kingdom of the Harp](http://www.stereophile.com/content/joanna-newsom-kingdom-harp).

The album features a large cast of collaborators -- some familiar and some novel -- giving the album's songs the quality of "vignettes".

> I thought of the songs on *Divers* as each running a leg of a relay, that, if it were retraced, would describe, in relief, the shape of what the album was about. [...] I wanted there to be a fundamental character difference, where they feel like different vignettes. And I felt like one way to achieve that would be to have different compositional voices overlaid to contrast against the thing that connects all the songs to each other."[^eggers]

Though the album features an eclectic mix of instruments, the only voices on the album are those of birds and of Newsom. This latter was often duplicated to make a "chorus of Joanna Newsoms". According to Newsom, this "was a choice for this record. ...In 'Waltz of the 101st Lightborne',... that's sort of the horror/sci-fi version of doubling and there's constant references to the doubling of the self and the halving of the self, the binary of the self throughout the record... ."[^paste]

# Album artwork, aesthetic and physical copies #

Newsom's collaborator for the photography of this album, Annabel Mehran, reportedly "dubbed the aesthetic of the songs pastoral futurism."[^vogue] Though this is the first album not to feature Newsom herself on the cover, she says it is still a "[portrait] of the narrator of the record."[^rookie] The back cover appears to be a still from the Divers music video. The album also features photographs from the promotional shoot conducted by Mehran.[^mehrandivers] Carl Wilson used the artwork as a starting-point for an interesting essay on the album and two of its contemporaries, ["Joanna Newsom, Iris DeMent and Elena Ferrante: Three women performing vanishing acts in order to be seen more clearly"](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2015/11/joanna_newsom_iris_dement_and_elena_ferrante_three_women_performing_vanishing.html).

## Kim Keever pieces ##

The album cover is *Wildflowers 52i* by Kim Keever. In the liner notes, the title page preceding each song's lyrics is printed alongside a different piece by Keever. (The titles of these pieces are listed at the end of the booklet.) Keever and Newsom also collaborated on the music video for "Divers", which was shot in Keever's studio.

In contrast to the artwork of earlier albums, which were commissioned, *Divers*' Keever pieces were 'off-the-peg'. Newsom says she first came across Keever's work "five or six years ago [while] walking around in New York City."[^rookie] She owns his piece *West 104k*, which faces "Sapokanikan" in the lyrics booklet. Keever was interviewed by *The 405* in relation to his Wildflowers series in [Behind the Artwork: Joanna Newsom's Divers](http://www.thefourohfive.com/music/article/behind-the-artwork-joanna-newsom-s-divers-144). He is also briefly profiled in Uncut in relation to the album.[^uncut]

## Details of the vinyl ##

Newsom is a known vinyl enthusiast, and had this to say on the subject of two of the formats on which the album was released:

> I think that this record is sort of pinned up, for viewing purposes, with a series of tacks that represent various points of binary tension. It's sort of held apart by these contrasts, within the body of the record, and that's one of them. It's going to sound best on vinyl, but from a dissecting standpoint, it definitely is most complete if you observe it in that digital format.[^paste]

The vinyl (double LP) album is notable for having inscriptions on each side.[^discogs] These are largely excerpts from the lyrics, with the exception of the side D inscription, which on some copies reads

> NIGHTJAR, TRANSMIT! (ONCE MORE, AND INNUMERABLE TIMES MORE

## Outtakes ##


The missing song mentioned by Newsom in at least one interview turned out to be "Making Hay", which was released by Drag City a year after the album's launch. It sounds to be a demo version, similar to the demo version of "Anecdotes", which surfaced some months after the release of the album and which also lacks the high level of production and complex instrumentation heard on the album.
