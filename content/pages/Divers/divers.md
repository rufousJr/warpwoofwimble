Title: Divers (song)
Release: Divers

Newsom talked about this song's title and its relation to the themes of the album in an interview with NPR.
> The diving imagery is the most literal in this song, but there are incidents of diving in various forms throughout the record: falling, or crashing an airplane, or dive-bombing, or being a bird diving for prey.[^npr]

The phrase "infinite regress" makes this page an appropriate place to note the tongue-in-cheek FAQ purportedly posed by Newsom to her occasional collaborators, Golden Shoulders, on their website:[^goldenshoulders]

> **Q: How does Thomas Kuhn's paradigmatic definition of theory-pure data, particularly in terms of its correlation with the epistemological account of sense data offerred up by Rouseau--in answer to Descartes' solipsistic and axiomatic arrest of the infinite regress (i.e. Je crois, alors j'existe)--relate to the passage in "Long Time to Come," in which you vent, rather Foucault-like (to use an eponymous reference that tends towards the pedestrian) about your frustration with the delay in your personal transition form the acute verbosity of your sexual experience as a simple institutionlized discourse, into a productive and internal condition of the formerly superstructural position of exteriority with respect to you, totally being able to finally come? Cause that was rad.**

> A: Ladies and gentlemen, this question was brought to you by Joanna Newsom. Someday you'll see it framed above your table at the Hard Rock Caf√© in Tuscon next to a Josh Klinghoffer guitar pick and the ashes of Bob Seger.
