Title: The Things I Say
Release: Divers

Newsom talked about this song in the larger context of the album in an interview with The Stranger.

> The song played a part in a larger role, though. The thing about this record is that not only did certain songs have very specific rules governing how the story was going to be told and how the lyrics needed to be arranged, but also the record itself had a superimposed structure that was very specific, and basically from quite early in the process --- not from the very beginning, but from the budding first leaves up, let's say --- I was pretty clear on what the sequence of songs was going to have to be, and because of that I did know where in the overall arc of the album this song --- "The Things I Say" --- was going to land. But that consideration was one of the things that governed the mood --- the fact that it wasn't arranged densely at all, just solo piano and voice. It affected the tone, the perspective of what that story is about because of where it fell in the sequence.[^stranger]

# Reversed portion #

Towards the end of the song, some of the tracks are reversed, notably the piano and voice parts. The reversed tracks sound like they are reproductions of earlier parts of the song.
