!!! lyrics ""
	> And tillers make hay:  
	> In windrow and bale,  
	> With tedder and rake;

The title of the song is a truncation of the English proverb, "make hay while the sun shines," which is said to originate in the line from Horace's *Odes*, *carpe diem, quam minimum credula postero*. However, several words and images in the song relate to agriculture -- including the literal making of hay (especially the lines quoted above).

!!! lyrics ""
	> She dotted her eyes;  
	> Crossed the teasels in her leaning dray

These lines are a pun on the English idomatic expression, "to dot the i's and cross the t's."

!!! lyrics ""
	> Where buzzards make circles  
	> ...  
	> A dozen in kettle, committee & wake;

While unrelated at first glance, the final three words quoted here are all ornithological terms: "kettle" denotes a group of birds circling in flight, while "committee" and "wake" are collective nouns applied to vultures (including the buzzard).

!!! lyrics ""
	> Where wind made the dust  
	> And sin made the snake,  
	> ...
	> Where Adam made ribs

There are two clear references in the song to the biblical book of Genesis, and in particular the story of the Fall. The final line of the song, "We sow and we reap, again," is a paraphrase of the famous line from St. Paul's Letter to the Galatians. READ THEN REF VERSES
