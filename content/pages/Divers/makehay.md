Title: Make Hay
Release: Divers (outtake)

The existence of this song was revealed around the time of the album's release by an interview with Newsom in Rookie Magazine.

> Well, I cut a whole song.
>
> **Oh, wow.**
>
> It was having a diluting or weakening effect, I think. It was approaching but not reaching the thing I wanted it to be, and it was pulling focus away. It was also a bit of a stretch harmonically; it didn't totally work in this pattern I was setting up. It kind of worked, I could justify it, but it was a weak link, harmonically speaking.
>
> **Are there any remanants of [the cut song] in the other songs?**
>
> There's a lyrical remnant. A lot of the record has this binary thing, where ideas are set up in opposition to each other and create a tension. There's a key lyric, in the last song on the record, "Time, as a Symptom," a lyric, "I was wrong, it pains me to say I was wrong. / Love is not a symptom of time, time is a symptom of love." That's in reference to the establishing claim that was made in the song that was cut. But it seemed unnecessary because it was all in there already, it was redundant in a way.[^rookie]

# Annotations #

!!! lyrics ""
	> And tillers make hay:  
	> In windrow and bale,  
	> With tedder and rake;

The title of the song is a truncation of the English proverb, "make hay while the sun shines," which is said to originate in the Latin motto *carpe diem*, taken from Horace's *Odes*. However, several words and images in the song relate to agriculture -- including the literal making of hay (especially the lines quoted above).

!!! lyrics ""
	> She dotted her eyes;  
	> Crossed the teasels in her leaning dray

These lines are a pun on the English idiomatic expression, "to dot the i's and cross the t's."

!!! lyrics ""
	> Where buzzards make circles  
	> ...  
	> A dozen in kettle, committee & wake;

While unrelated at first glance, the final three words quoted here are all ornithological terms: "kettle" denotes a group of birds circling in flight, while "committee" and "wake" are collective nouns applied to vultures (including the buzzard). (More tenuously, this song could be considered to make the number of tracks on *Divers* a dozen.)

!!! lyrics ""
	> Where wind made the dust  
	> And sin made the snake,  
	> ...
	> "Where Adam made ribs  
	> And cattle make steak."

There are two clear references in the song to the biblical story of the Creation (Genesis 1-3). Additionally, the final line of the song, "We sow and we reap, again," is a paraphrase of the famous pronouncement from St. Paul's Letter to the Galatians, "Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap." (Galatians 6:7)
