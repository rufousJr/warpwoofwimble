	> Short flight; free descent.  
	> Poor flight attendant.

As noted by Andrew Badr at joannanewsomlyrics.com:

> **Perhaps a reimagining of former airline stewardess FranÃ§oise de Moriere's inadvertent dive. In 1962, she fell to her death after being swept mid-flight out of an emergency exit door. The New York Times article ("Stewardess Is Swept Through Plane Door") on the event inspired James L. Dickey to write his famous poem, "Falling".**[^jnlyrics]

	> from the Great Light that shines through a pin-hole,  
	> when the pin-light calls itself Selfhood,  
	> and the Selfhood inverts on a mirror  
	> in an Amora Obscura.

Hey, if you think this site is niche and obsessive, you should take a look at [The Magic Mirror of Life: an appreciation of the camera obscura][cameraobscura]. "Amora Obscura" is a pun, but the preceding lines of lyric make it clear that a camera obscura-like object is the principal reference here.
