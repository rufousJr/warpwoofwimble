Two birdcalls are heard at the beginning of the album recording. As stated in the liner notes, one is that of the mourning dove. The other seems to be the white-crowned sparrow.

!!! lyrics ""
	> a way a lone a last a loved a long.

This line is an excerpt from the novel *Finnegans Wake* by James Joyce. Specifically, it is a fragment that appears twice, as the first and last words of the book. (The silk dresses worn by Newsom in the promotional photography for *Divers* are from the clothing line Awaveawake. Coincidence?)

!!! lyrics ""
	> (Areion, Rharian, go free and graze. Amen.)

Th names Areion and Rharian are taken from Gree<i>k myth</i>ology. The Rharian fields are associated with the gift of agriculture, given to humanity by the goddess Demeter, whose horse-son is named Areion.
