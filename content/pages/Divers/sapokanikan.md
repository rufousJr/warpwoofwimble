"Sapokanikan" was described by Newsom as concerning "the roles that documentation plays in our concept of cultural permanence or cultural impermanence".[^stranger]

This song has a notoriously large number of historical references within. In an interview around the time of the release of the music video, Newsom said, "...only hours after the video was out...a lot of the material elements of the song --- meaning the things that could be deciphered or could be researched --- had been thoroughly found at that point. As of the last time I saw it, there were still a few little things that hadn't been figured out, so I was like, 'Haha! You haven't got that yet!' But they had gotten so much of it."[^stereogum]

Newsom apologises to several of the referenced people "for liberties taken" in the liner notes.

# Annotations #

## Ozymandias ##

The lyrics contain numerous words and phrases taken from the well-known poem *Ozymandias* by Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792--1822), as well as its contemporary, but lesser-known namesake by Horace Smith (1779--1849). The connection was explained by Newsom as follows:

> I had never known about the second 'Ozymandias' poem, the Horace Smith poem. The Horace Smith one is essentially the same and maybe better, but the Shelley one became part of the popular consciousness. If you say 'Ozymandias', it's shorthand for an idea, and people who aren't English scholars or even poetry fans know about it. Within that context, the Horace Smith 'Ozymandias' is just lost, and I was thinking about the phenomenon of one of those poems becoming what it describes. It doesn't just describe the poem, it describes the process of the rendering of obsolescence. I think any record, any remnant is inherently cryptic. We're just seeing the elements of any institution or phenomenon or person or event that endure, and those elements are in many cases the result of bias, in many cases the result of arbitrariness, randomness, in many cases the result of acts of God, as it were. We're never experiencing anything as real, we're experiencing a distorted, adulterated, or aggrandised, or lionised, or different version of the past. It was a really exciting idea for me.[^uncut]

## Greenwich Village ##

The lyrics contain a few clear references to the Greenwich Village area of New York City. Newsom has said:
> I think probably the very beginning kernel of that song would have come from just walking around in Washington Square Park, ... Central Park ..., and ... Greenwich Village. There are a few other monuments that are referenced in that song as well that are just sort of buried throughout the Village. And getting very curious about what those monuments actually represent, what they're memorializing. They're all kind of odd. It's not that it's odd to memorialize the people whom they are memorializing, it's that they commemorate the moments that they're commemorating.[^paste]

Firstly, 'Sapokanikan' was a Lenape Indian name for a settlement located in the area now called Greenwich Village.

!!! lyrics ""
	> (interred with other daughters, in dirt, in other potter's fields).  
	> Above them,  
	> parades mark the passing of days  
	> through parks where pale colonnades arch  
	> in marble and steel,  
	> where all of the Twenty Thousand attending your foot fall  
	> (and the Cause that they died for)  
	> are lost in the idling birdcalls,
	
The land now called Washington Square Park 'originated' as a potter's field and public execution grounds in 1797. Later, it was a parade ground, before being designated a public park in 1827. A marble arch honouring the centennial of George Washington's inauguration was erected by 1892. The inscription on the arch is referenced in the lyrics to this song, and reads, "LET US RAISE A STANDARD TO WHICH THE WISE AND HONEST CAN REPAIR / THE EVENT IS IN THE HAND OF GOD / --WASHINGTON".[^washington]

A few blocks away, in McCarthy Square, stands a monument erected in honour of  Private First Class Bernard James McCarthy, the first Greenwich Village resident to fall in the Second World War. It is dedicated to the "BRAVE MEN, WOMEN AND WORTHY PATRIOTS DEAR TO GOD AND FAMOUS TO ALL AGES".[^mccarthy]

## John Purroy Mitchel ##

The lyrics in the coda of the song tell some of the story of John Purroy Mitchel, Republican mayor of New York from 1914-17. They include quotations from his obituary in the New York Times. Mitchel campaigned in opposition of the (Democratic) Tammany Hall political machine, which is named after Tamanend, a leader of the Lenape Indians who once inhabited the New York area. His death, an inadvertent dive *from* his plane, foreshadows that of the flight attendant in [A Pin-Light, Bent]({filename}apinlightbent.md).

## Hidden paintings ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> the text will not yield  
	> (nor X-ray reveal, with any fluorescence)  
	> where the Hand of the Master begins and ends.

The lyrics contain a few references to paintings that were painted over and subsequently discovered by X-ray scanning techniques.

!!! lyrics ""
	> Beneath a Patch of Grass,  
	> her bones the old Dutch master hid,

Patch of Grass (1887) is a painting by the Dutch painter Van Gogh. X-ray analysis revealed a second painting, of a peasant woman, covered over by the first.

!!! lyrics ""
	> while, elsewhere, Tobias and the Angel disguised  
	> what the scholars surmised was a mother and kid

Tobias and the Angel was a painting attributed to a follower of the Old Master Titian. X-ray analysis revealed a second painting covered over by the first. A subsequent restoration, removing the top layer of paint, exposed an unfinished work by Titian, since dubbed Portrait of a Lady and Her Daughter. This work seemed to have been painted over after his death in order to make the painting saleable, transforming the nature of its subjects in the process.

!!! lyrics ""
	> I call and call for the doctor,  
	> but the snow swallows me whole,  
	> with old Florry Walker.

Spring (1890), by Australian impressionist Arthur Streeton, was found during a restoration to have hidden references to Florry Walker, a sweetheart of the artist.

In the process of writing the above annotations, I came across two pieces that might be of interest to the reader. Christopher Laws wrote a piece entitled [Themes and References in Joanna Newsom's Sapokanikan][culturedarm], which is a more detailed, hyperlinked and thoroughly-researched version of my annotations. Then Michael Hicks wrote an analysis that goes over all of the widely-accepted references and posits a whole heap more too. That one is named ["The Text Will not Yield": Fleeting Tesserae in Joanna Newsom's Sapokanikan][tesserae].
