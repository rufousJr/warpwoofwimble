## Birds ##

The album recording opens with birdsong --- if anyone can identify it, contact me! --- and the lyrics are littered with references to the names and behaviours of various birds.

The family of birds called nightjar is the focus, including mentions of the names of three types: the rufous nightjar, the star-spotted nightjar, and the sickle-winged nightjar. Much of the song uses military terminology to describe common behaviour of these birds.

!!! lyrics ""
	> "When are you from?" said he,  
	> in our blind of winter leaves,  
	> as we sighted out their fliers  
	> in the grayscale of the night  
	> fumbled on the bare ground  
	> to bury round landmines,  
	> while the dew lay down and dried.
	> 
	> ...
	> 
	> laying in our state of torpor,  
	> waiting out the day

The nightjar typically inhabits woodland, heaths and forest edges, and its plumage resembles bark or leaves. It is nocturnal, being most active soon after dusk. Some species undergo daily torpor in the daytime. It is unsuited to walking, yet lays its eggs (here "landmines") on the ground.

!!! lyrics ""
	> We signal Private Poorwill, when morning starts to loom:  
	> "Pull up from your dive!"  
	> till we hear the telltale Boom,  
	> too soon ---  
	> hotdogging loon, caught there  
	> like a shard of mirror in the moon!

'Poorwill' is an onomatopoeic representation of the nightjar's call, and is contained in the names of many species of nightjar, notably the whip-poor-will, a bird mythologised in story and song as having associations with death. During breeding season, the nightjar claps its wings to make a cracking sound --- a boom, if you will.

The loon, or diver, is a large aquatic bird.
