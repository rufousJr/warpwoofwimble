Title: Leaving the City
Release: Divers

Newsom is quoted in detail regarding the rhyme scheme of this song in a article for The Stranger. The article also features a reproduction of the rhyme chart described by Newsom.

> "['Leaving the City'] has the rhyme at the end of each line and the internal rhymes that follow one meter, and a secondary set of internal rhymes that sort of quietly annunciate a contrary meter that's overlaid on the first meter." She also said she "overlaid a contrary musical meter" on top of all that, and that I had to be "conscious of the sublimated contrary meter in order to trace the rhyme."[^stranger]

!!! lyrics ""
	> The bridle bends in idle hands  
	> and slows our canter to a trots  
	> We mean to stop, in increments, but can't commit.  
	> We post and sit, in impotence:

The canter and the trot are two horse gaits, while posting and sitting are horserider positions.
