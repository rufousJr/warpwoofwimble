Title: Same Old Man
Release: Divers

Newsom talked about her relationship with this song in an interview with Rookie Magazine.

> ...I covered ["Same Old Man"] years ago, when I was touring. I think the first time I performed this song was at an orchestral show at Brooklyn Academy of Music. I've always loved that song, and specifically the Karen Dalton version. The harp version has always been really exciting to me.[^rookie]

At the end of the song, the sound of helicopter blades can be heard.
