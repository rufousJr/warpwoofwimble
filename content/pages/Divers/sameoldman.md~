> **A reader named Vitor asked, "How did you choose to cover 'Same Old Man' on this album?"**

> It was actually a song that I covered years ago, when I was touring. I think the first time I performed this song was at an orchestral show at Brooklyn Academy of Music. I've always loved that song, and specifically the Karen Dalton version. The harp version has always been really exciting to me.
