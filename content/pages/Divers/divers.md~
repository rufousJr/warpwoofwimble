> **Let me ask you about the title track from Divers, and the lines, "A diver is my love / And I am his, if I am not deceived." What do you take from the image of a diver? What do you want us to take from it?**

>It's a little simplistic for me to say that I write down the images that are in my mind, because it's not like I just have a frozen image that I'm illustrating with the language. But it's maybe a set of, sort of, visual imperatives and feelings and ideas that feel connected to me, and feel like they're waiting to be connected. The diving imagery is the most literal in this song, but there are incidents of diving in various forms throughout the record: falling, or crashing an airplane, or dive-bombing, or being a bird diving for prey.
