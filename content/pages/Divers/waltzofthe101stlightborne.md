Release: divers
Authors: Rufous Nightjar

!!! epigraph ""
	> There was a sudden sunburst in my head.  
	>
	> And then black night. That blackness was sublime.  
	> I felt distributed through space and time:  
	> One foot upon a mountaintop, one hand  
	> Under the pebbles of a panting strand,  
	> One ear in Italy, one eye in Spain,  
	> In caves, my blood, and in the stars, my brain.  
	> There were dull throbs in my Triassic; green  
	> Optical spots in upper Pleistocene,  
	> An icy shiver down my age of stone,  
	> And all tomorrows in my funnybone.
	> <footer>Vladimir Nabokov / John Shade, from <cite>Pale Fire</cite></footer>

A narrative for this song was outlined by Newsom in Paste Magazine.[^paste]

> **I've often wondered too about the instances when you double or triple your voice and make it a chorus of Joanna Newsoms, which you do a lot on this album. Is that because you can't find the right voice, or the right person who gets what you're going for?**

> No, it was a choice for this record. I've had other people sing harmonies on records in the past. But one of the sort of sci-fi notions on this record is the idea of traveling sideways through time, colonizing various iterations of the multiverse in which human life never evolved to exist in the first place, having that be a form of population control. In "Waltz of the 101st Lightborne," there's this sort of horror movie sting that happens at the end, where a different version of Earth evolved to develop the exact same set of technological advances and basically, an iteration of Earth occurred where all of the conditions were exactly the same, and so it's basically a copy, and they're coming over to colonize in reverse, and this idea of doubling, so that's sort of the horror/sci-fi version of doubling and there's constant references to the doubling of the self and the halving of the self, the binary of the self throughout the record, so it seems to be the most sensible move to have myself be doubled and copied over and over again, singing harmonies, rather than bringing in another person.

# Annotations #

## Human geography ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> Saw his ship in its whistling ascension,  
	> as they launched from the Capitol seat ---
	>
	> (But I saw the Bering Strait and the Golden Gate,  
	>in silent suspension of their golden age!  
	>
	> ...
	>
	> And I had a dream that I walked in the garden  
	> of Chabot, and those telescope ruins.

The lyrics clearly reference two Californian landmarks: the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco, and the Chabot Science and Space Center in Oakland. In context, the Capitol seat might well be the California State Capitol in Sacramento.

## Continental geography ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> And we bade goodbye  
	> to the Great Divide:  
	> found unlimited simulacreage to colonize!

The lyrics also reference larger features of terrain: the Bering Strait, which separates Alaska from eastern Russia, and the Continental Divide of the Americas, whose northern extent is the Bering Strait.

Oh, and don't waste time looking up 'simulacreage' in the dictionary!

## "Lowlands Away" ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> That's why we got bound to a round desert island,  
	> 'neath the sky where our sailors have gone.  
	> Have they drowned, in those windy highlands?  
	> *Highlands away, my John.*

In an interview, Newsom said, "[I contrast] this British Isles sea shanty with a narrative in which I'm talking about colonizing alternative iterations of the terrestral position in the multiverse."[^fader] The shanty is "Lowlands Away", and its connection with "Waltz..." is analysed by Melissa of Blessing All the Birds, in ["Lowlands Away" and "Waltz of the 101st Lightborne"][batb].
