!!! lyrics ""
	> But you had somewhere that you had to go,  
	> and you caught that flight out of Covalo.

"Covalo" might be a misspelling of "Covelo", the name of a Californian town near a small airstrip, Round Valley Airport.

!!! lyrics ""
	> and we cut facsimilies of love and death

This encourages reading the song with reference to the Freudian concepts of Eros and Thanatos.
