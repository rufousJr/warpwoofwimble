# Annotations #

## Bird calls ##

Two birdcalls are heard at the beginning of the album recording. As stated in the liner notes, one is that of the mourning dove. The other seems to be the white-crowned sparrow. On the subject of the mourning dove's call, Newsom said:
> This bird call affects me very deeply, it would also be the bird call that I would hear in the evening in our [childhood] house and I have lots of different associations with it. There is something in the chorus that the vocal does that reminded me of it[...].[^badday]

## Classical mythology ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> And in our perfect secret-keeping:  
	> One ear of corn,  
	> in silent, reaping  
	> joy of life.  
	> [...]  
	> (Areion, Rharian, go free and graze. Amen.)

The names Areion and Rharian are taken from Greek mythology. The Rharian fields are associated with the gift of agriculture, given to humanity by the goddess Demeter, whose horse-son is named Areion. Taken with the earlier reference to an ear of corn, an allusion to the ancient Greek initiations known as the Eleusinian mysteries becomes apparent. User '~Jordan' on the Milky Moon forums gave an excellent [explanation and analysis](http://www.fromamouth.com/milkymoon/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=1424) of this part.

In an interview with the New York Times magazine, Newsom discussed the tiara made for her wedding:

> [Irene Neuwirth is] my good friend, and I had always dreamed of owning one of her pieces. So a tiara seemed like the obvious and practical choice! She made one for my wedding, which was amazing. She worked on it for seven months. It’s a wreath of flowers made out of opals, emeralds and diamonds. I had this idea for my dress and the wedding design that I was calling ‘pastoral maximalism’ that was inspired by Czech Art Nouveau and Austrian secessionism and Greek agrarian mythology. Because I overthink everything. That’s just the tip of the iceberg…[^nyt]

Perhaps this phrase was on Newsom's mind when she said that Annabel Mehran "dubbed the aesthetic of the songs pastoral futurism."[^vogue]

## Allusions ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> *a way a lone a last a loved a long.*

This line is an excerpt from the novel *Finnegans Wake* by James Joyce. Specifically, it is a fragment that appears twice, as the first and last words of the book. Newsom apologies to Joyce "for liberties taken" in the liner notes. (The silk dresses worn by Newsom in the promotional photography for *Divers* are from the clothing line Awaveawake. Coincidence?)

!!! lyrics ""
	> A shore, a tide, unmoored --- a sight, abroad:  
	> [...]  
	> White star, white ship[...]

It has been suggested that these lines refer to the tragedy of the RMS Titanic, which was operated by the White Star Line.
