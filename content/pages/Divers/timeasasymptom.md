# Annotations #

## Bird calls ##

Two birdcalls are heard at the beginning of the album recording. As stated in the liner notes, one is that of the mourning dove. The other seems to be the white-crowned sparrow.

## Literary allusions ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> a way a lone a last a loved a long.

This line is an excerpt from the novel *Finnegans Wake* by James Joyce. Specifically, it is a fragment that appears twice, as the first and last words of the book. Newsom apologies to Joyce "for liberties taken" in the liner notes. (The silk dresses worn by Newsom in the promotional photography for *Divers* are from the clothing line Awaveawake. Coincidence?)

!!! lyrics ""
	> (Areion, Rharian, go free and graze. Amen.)

Th names Areion and Rharian are taken from Greek mythology. The Rharian fields are associated with the gift of agriculture, given to humanity by the goddess Demeter, whose horse-son is named Areion. User ~Jordan on the Milky Moon forums gave an excellent [explanation and analysis](http://www.fromamouth.com/milkymoon/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=1424) of this part.
