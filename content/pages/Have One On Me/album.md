Newsom wrote most of the record on piano, an instrument which she admits is not her forte, in hopes of concentrating on melody and chord structure rather than any “athletics or embellishments” of instrumentation. Ironically, she says the project — which clocks in at over two hours — was initially “born out of a desire to make something simple.” But the songs kept coming, and eventually it became clear that they had taken on a life of their own.

“I couldn’t really identify the dividing aesthetic principle that would make the songs more than one album, more than one story arc,” she remembers. “To me, they felt so connected to each other and bound to each other.

“So, after looking at it long enough, I realized, first of all, that the structure was sort of three-part. I was working so hard to break the songs into two halves and it just didn’t work. Then at some point, when I stated to think of it in terms of a grouping of three, it just made sense. It felt like beginning, middle, end, or morning, noon, night. Sort of the three acts of a play. Somehow the story fit along that structure for me.”

You’ve said there’s a loose theme to Have One On Me. If you could describe the story being told in a sentence, what would it be?

It would be the title of the record, in the imperative mood.

Do you typically write songs on the harp?

For this album, for the first time ever, I decided to write the bulk of the songs on the piano. I’m not a very good piano player, and so I thought it would be an interesting exercise, to write songs on an instrument that absolved me of any obligation to do something interesting with my hands. I wanted to focus on the bones of the songs – the melodies and chords. Sometimes, with the harp, I can get carried away thinking about instrumental arrangements before the songs even know what they are, which ends up producing sort of frenetic, abstract work, with the fussiness of a premature infancy. I wanted these songs to be measured and solid, pitched low and heavy. Then, once they were sketched out, I switched back to the harp, to fill in the instrumental details.

She calls “Have One on Me,” which was released in late February, her “early ’70s California singer-songwriter album,” citing influences like Joni Mitchell’s “For the Roses” and Graham Nash’s “Songs for Beginners.” It’s also the record in which Newsom writes most explicitly about her home turf.

“This record deals a lot with the idea of home and hometown,” Newsom said. “People have described me as being so informed by the nature and the magic of this place. I think on this album I’m exploring that — I’m working through that idea. There’s a lot of mythologizing of Nevada City as this utopian magical hippieland.”

For the cover photo of “Have One on Me,” Newsom dragged many of her belongings into her living room — a stuffed peacock, a leopard-print ottoman, tchotchkes and clothes and rugs and partitions — and arranged them on and around her couch, which sits in front of a wall-hung 18th-century tapestry. It’s a cabinet of curiosities, with Newsom mounted in the middle: stretched out on the sofa wearing a strapless dress and a flapper headband, peering back at the viewer, sphinxlike, with mascara-ringed eyes.

In other words, “Have One on Me,” like so many of Newsom’s songs, is bound up with the mythos of Nevada City. Travel, distance, exile, the yearning for home — Newsom returns to these themes repeatedly. The album’s emotional centerpiece is “In California,” a slow-boiling ballad sung in the voice of woman torn between longing for her far-flung lover and the siren call of her homeland. “If you want to know how Joanna feels about Nevada City,” Ryan Francesconi told me, “just read the lyrics to ‘In California’ very closely. It’s all in there — her relationship to her land, and her relationship of being in this place while people she loves are far away.”

How long did it take you to make this record?
I think technically in terms of calender years, I think three or four years. Since I finished Ys. And not all of that time was intense. There was a year of just songwriting that was intense and there was a year that followed it doing the arrangements (with Ryan Francesconi). It took two months just to write out drafts of his arrangements. There was a lot of back and forth. The recording process which happened all over the place and took five months or four months. It was spread apart. And the making took about two months or a month and a half.

all of this, eg.

For a period, Newsom considered releasing the recordings as a double album, but she felt that the sequencing didn't work. "Somehow, when I began to think of it in a three-part form, it worked for me," she says. "Obviously, it's so much information, and the thing that I liked about the triple album shape is that it started to feel like three chapters or three acts in a play." Newsom also sequenced Have One on Me so that each of the vinyl LP's six sides would comprise three songs. "There's a little mini-arc on the LP," she explains. "It was very important to me to sequence the record as an LP. So it's got three main arcs, and then each one is broken into sides. If you look at each side, the sets of three are all arranged differently. There is no set of three, side by side, that have the same instrumentation on them."

RH How much of a part do you think your personal beauty plays in your vision of life?

JN Well, Roy, the phrasing of your question makes it seem like that beauty thing is a given, which is nice of you, although not necessarily the consensus. Certain aspects of physical appearance are mutable, boiling down to mere decisions, and, to the extent that those decisions operate as elements of an artistic project, I consider them valuable. All my three record covers depicted "me" in an allegorical setting — embroidered, on the first album cover; painted, on the second; and then photographed on the third. In each case, there are factors relating to physical appearance that can be tempered to underscore the spirit of the album and the identity of its narrator. The photo on the cover of Have One on Me was modeled after typical Orientalist fantasy-figure iconography, like an odalisque or a Venus in Furs — a sort of cartoonish amalgamation of feminine signifiers stylized to illustrate the Lacanian idea "Woman is a symptom of man." Annabel Mehran, the photographer, used black-and-white film that the artist Becca Mann later hand-tinted over with watercolors. The idea was to mock-up a shabby, 1920s Parisian studio with an absinthe-dulled lady posing on a divan in bits of old drapery fabric, and then paint over the resulting tableau into some idealized. Technicolor, hedonistic fantasy set. The specifically female, earthbound, corporeal, and decadent character in that album art reflects the character of those songs' narrator as well as the idea of feminine self-diminishment. That was a definite application of the idea of beauty. I don't know whether that specific application could have any reason to occur again for me creatively. I have no idea who the narrator of my next record will be, and whether there will be a clear physical embodiment of that character.
