"Star of the County Down" is an Irish folk song, whose tune features in the arrangement for "Autumn":

>  Ryan Francesconi had so many little narrative winks and Easter eggs in his arrangements [for *Have One On Me*]. There’s ... a line in ["Autumn"] that references the song, “Star of the County Down,” and he buried that song throughout his arrangement.[^rookie]

This is clearly inspired by the opening lines of Nabokov's *Pale Fire* (see ["Only Skin"]({filename}../../Ys/onlyskin.md)).
