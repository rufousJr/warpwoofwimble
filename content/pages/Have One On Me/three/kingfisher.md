Title: Kingfisher
Release: Have One On Me

According to Newsom, this song was one of the first to be written after *Ys*.[^source]

[^source]: "I started "Kingfisher" sometime between when I recorded *Ys* and when the album came out." ["Joanna Newsom: The Siren's Song"](http://americansongwriter.com/2010/09/joanna-newsom-the-sirens-song/), *American Songwriter*, Evan Schlansky, Sep 2010

!!! lyrics ""
    > Blows rained upon the one you loved,    
    > and, thought you were only sparring,  
    > there's blood on the eye.  
    > Unlace the glove.  
    > Say, *Honey I am not sorry.*

It is possible that the sense of 'eye' meant here is 'a small metal loop' -- related to the definition of 'eyelet': a small round hole made in leather or cloth, used for threading a lace, string or rope through (OED).

    > And, for the sake of that pit of snakes,

    > *but he loved me just like a little child;  
    > like a little child loves a little lamb.*

The concluding line of the song makes clear the allusion (hinted at in earlier lines) to the famous verses from Isaiah 11:

> **6** "The wolf shall also dwell with the lamb,  
> The leopard shall lie down with the young goat,  
> The calf and the young lion and the fatling together;  
> And a little child shall lead them.  
> **7** The cow and the bear shall graze;  
> Their young ones shall lie down together;  
> And the lion shall eat straw like the ox.  
> **8** The nursing child shall play by the cobra's hole,  
> And the weaned child shall put his hand in the viper's den.  
> **9** They shall not hurt nor destroy all in My holy mountain.  
> For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord  
> As the waters cover the sea.

Interpretations of this song often link it with the Pompeii tragedy and modern man's reproductions thereof in the form of the atom bomb. With regard to the eponymous Kingfisher, some proposed identities include: the Fisher King of Arthurian legend; Jesus, the 'fisher of men'; and Alcyone of Greek mythology, who is (in Greek) the namesake of the kingfisher.
