Title: Kingfisher
Release: Have One On Me

According to Newsom, this song was one of the first to be written after *Ys*:

> **Which songs came first on the record? Were they all written post-*Ys*?**
>
> I started "Kingfisher" sometime between when I recorded *Ys* and when the album came out. And I remember writing the instrumental part to "Have One On Me" on a big old beautiful grand piano in the Sear Sound studio, in New York, while Jim O'Rourke was observing his monastic session of solitary *Ys* mixing, and I was waiting to be let back in the room.[^source]

    > Blows rained upon the one you loved,    
    > and, thought you were only sparring,  
    > there's blood on the eye.  
    > Unlace the glove.  
    > Say, *Honey I am not sorry.*

It is possible that the sense of 'eye' meant here is 'a small metal loop' -- related to the definition of 'eyelet': a small round hole made in leather or cloth, used for threading a lace, string or rope through (OED).

Two common interpretations of this song link it with the Fisher King of Arthurian legend and the Pompeii tragedy; the concluding line of the song makes clear the allusion (hinted at in earlier lines) to the famous verses from Isaiah 11:

> **6** "The wolf shall also dwell with the lamb,  
> The leopard shall lie down with the young goat,  
> The calf and the young lion and the fatling together;  
> And a little child shall lead them.  
> **7** The cow and the bear shall graze;  
> Their young ones shall lie down together;  
> And the lion shall eat straw like the ox.  
> **8** The nursing child shall play by the cobra's hole,  
> And the weaned child shall put his hand in the viper's den.  
> **9** They shall not hurt nor destroy all in My holy mountain.  
> For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord  
> As the waters cover the sea.
