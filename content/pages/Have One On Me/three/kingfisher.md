Which songs came first on the record? Were they all written post-Ys?

I started “Kingfisher” sometime between when I recorded “Ys” and when the album came out. And I remember writing the instrumental part to “Have One On Me” on a big old beautiful grand piano in the Sear Sound studio, in New York, while Jim O’Rourke was observing his monastic session of solitary “Ys” mixing, and I was waiting to be let back in the room.
