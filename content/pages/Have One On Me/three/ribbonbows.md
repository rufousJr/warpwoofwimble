!!! lyrics ""
    > I stood, a-wagging, at the tap;  
    > just a-waiting on the lagging, rising sap.  
    > I held the cold tin ladle to my lip.  
    > At the Shrine of the Thousand Arms,  
    > I lowered my eyes to sip.

It has been suggested that the "Shrine of the Thousand Arms" is devoted to the Buddhist figure of Guanyin. On the other hand, it could be a poetic circumlocution for a tree, given that the preceding lines seem to refer to drawing sap thereof ('lagging' is a process for insulating pipes).

The narrator seems to compare herself to a dog, and Newsom makes much of the opportunity for canine puns, such as 'hangdog' and the symmetry of 'dog' against 'god'.

    > I'll be a sport,  
    > and have a go at that old song,  
    > singing unabashed, about  
    > '*Them city girls,  
    > with their ribbon bows,  
    > and their fancy sash...*'

These lines are almost certainly a reference to the pop song "Ribbon Bow", popularised in the 1960s by Fairport Convention and also recorded by Karen Dalton (see ["Same Old Man"]({filename}../../Divers/sameoldman.md)).[^ribbon]
