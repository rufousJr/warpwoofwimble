The narrator seems to compare herself to a dog, and Newsom makes much of the opportunity for canine puns, such as 'hangdog' and the symmetry of 'dog' against 'god'. Additionally, while the "lagging, rising sap" is likely primarily meant to be falling behind (*ie.* lagging), the process of insulating tanks and pipes is also called 'lagging'.
