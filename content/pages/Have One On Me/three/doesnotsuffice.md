Title: Does Not Suffice
Release: Have One On Me

<!--!!! epigraph ""
    > I oft have smiled to see the foolery  
    > Of some sweet youths, who seriously protest  
    > That love respects not actual luxury,  
    > But only joys to dally, sport and jest.  
    > Love is a child, contented with a toy;  
    > A busk-point or some favour stills the boy.
    > <cite> from "The Metamorphosis of Pygmalion's Image", John Marston</cite>

!!! epigraph ""
    > Who died on the wires, and hung there, one of two --  
    > Who for his hours of life had chattered through  
    > Infinite lovely chatter of Bucks accent;  
    > Yet faced unbroken wires; stepped over, and went,  
    > A noble fool, faithful to his stripes -- and ended.
    > <cite> from "The Silent One", <author>Ivor Gurney</author></cite>-->
