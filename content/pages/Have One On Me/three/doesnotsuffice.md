Title: Does Not Suffice
Release: Have One On Me

!!! "" epigraph
    > Who died on the wires, and hung there, one of two --  
    > Who for his hours of life had chattered through  
    > Infinite lovely chatter of Bucks accent;  
    > Yet faced unbroken wires; stepped over, and went,  
    > A noble fool, faithful to his stripes -- and ended.
    > <cite> from "The Silent One", <author>Ivor Gurney</author></cite>

What’s a song you’re particularly proud of on the album, and why?

“Does Not Suffice,” I think. And “On A Good Day.” Simplicity is sometimes hardest for me.
