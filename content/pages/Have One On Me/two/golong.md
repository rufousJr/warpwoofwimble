Title: Go Long

## Bluebeard ##

!!! lyrics ""
    > Run away from home--  
    > Your beard is still blue

The song contains several allusions to the folk tale of Bluebeard, to the extent that it could be considered a retelling of the tale. This aspect of the song has been considered in great detail in a series of posts at Blessing All the Birds ([1][], [2][], [3][], [4][]).

In this part of the Bluebeard story, the words echo the famous lines from Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet* (II, ii, 43):

> What's in a name? That which we call a rose    
> By any other word would smell as sweet.

    > (which were the probable cause),

"Probable cause" is a legal term meaning evidence that a crime is being committed.

    > There's a man  
    > who will only speak in code,  
    > backing slowly, slowly down the road.    
    > May he master everything  
    > that such men may know  
    > about loving, and then letting go.

The final stanza appears to refer to Newsom's Drag City labelmate and champion, Bonnie "Prince" Billy, who has released albums entitled *Ease Down the Road*, *Master and Everyone*, and *The Letting Go* (whose title is itself a reference to the Emily Dickinson poem, "After great pain, a formal feeling comes").
