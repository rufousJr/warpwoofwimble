# Annotations #

The final verse casts a Biblical pall over the song: 'Matthew' clearly means the gospel according to Matthew, while figs are a common Biblical symbol (primordially in the Eden story). As for the "verse" that "spoke to" Newsom, it is unclear which verse, if any, is paraphrased in the proceeding lines. The book of Matthew often mentions the idea of a fiery Hell, and also the idea of giving up ones earthly riches for freedom in the afterlife (eg. 29:24, "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God").

However, the idea of personal freedom is perhaps better covered by 11:25-30:

> **28** "Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  
> **29** "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.  
> **30** "For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."

And the "low-down flame" evokes the parable of the lamp under the bushel, recounted in 5:14-16:

> **14** "You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.  
> **15** "Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.  
> **16** "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven."
