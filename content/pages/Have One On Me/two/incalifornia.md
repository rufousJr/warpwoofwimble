Title: In California
Release: Have One On Me

As the title would suggest, this song is an exploration of Newsom's relationship with her home state of California. As Jody Rosen wrote for the New York Times,

> Travel, distance, exile, the yearning for home --- Newsom returns to these themes repeatedly. The album’s emotional centerpiece is "In California," a slow-boiling ballad sung in the voice of woman torn between longing for her far-flung lover and the siren call of her homeland. "If you want to know how Joanna feels about Nevada City," Ryan Francesconi told me, "just read the lyrics to 'In California' very closely. It’s all in there --- her relationship to her land, and her relationship of being in this place while people she loves are far away."[^nyt]

!!! lyrics ""
	> in California,  
	> watching the fox pick off my goldfish  
	> from their sorry, golden state --

The allusions to the flora, fauna and geography present in the song --- "Milk Lake", for example, happens to be the name of a Northern Californian fishing spot (just along the way from Lower Lola Montez Lake) --- will not be enumerated here; though in the lines quoted above, it is important to note that California's nickname is 'The Golden State'.

It is perfectly possible to appreciate the song without knowing what many of these totems signify to Newsom. Such a thought is, perhaps, what Newsom anticipates when she sings, "just like they told you it would; just like the Tulgeywood," which makes a punning allusion to Lewis Carroll's famous nonsense poem, ["Jabberwocky"][], whose titular beast "came whiffling through the tulgey wood, and burbled as it came!"
