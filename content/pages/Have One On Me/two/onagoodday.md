Title: On a Good Day
Release: Have One On Me

Along with ["Does Not Suffice"]({filename}../three/doesnotsuffice.md), Newsom named this song as one from *Have One On Me* of which she was particularly proud, with the justification that "simplicity is sometimes hardest for me".[^amso] It is an optimistic rejoinder to ["Same Old Man"]({filename}../../Divers/sameoldman.md), the folk standard that Newsom recorded for *Divers*.
