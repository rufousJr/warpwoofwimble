Title: You and Me, Bess
Release: Have One On Me

This song is often considered to be a retelling of the execution (for horse theft) of romanticised English highwayman Dick Turpin. 'Bess' is a common name for a horse; more specifically, a horse named Black Bess is associated with Turpin. On the other hand, the Americanisms and arguably Californian imagery that is found in some parts of the song make it tempting to link 'Bess' with *Gallant Bess*, a 1946 film whose titular character lived in Lincoln, California, a few tens of miles south of Newsom's hometown of Nevada City.[^lincoln]
