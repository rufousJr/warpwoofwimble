Title: Good Intentions Paving Company
Release: Have One On Me

# Annotations #

The title of the song is a riff on the proverb, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions". At the time of writing, Genius had an interesting annotation to the song, excerpted here:

> "The Good Intentions Paving Company" is a phrase attributable to the novelist Saul Bellow, from [a letter to fellow novelist Philip Roth][nyr][^letter]. Bellow is referring to well-meaning literary journalists and interviewers (who nonetheless have 'fucked up again'), but the phrase becomes applicable to all manner of agents and institutions, such as governments, healthcare providers, and universities.
>
> Whether the phrase originates with Bellow seems disputable: the author of [this article][wsj] claims to have heard it from Bellow's mouth itself, but still 'do[es't] know that Bellow invented the term'. There doesn’t seem to be any record online of Joanna Newsom mentioning Bellow, even though she is widely known to be well-read and to have found inspiration in literature.[^genius]

[^letter]: The letter reads in full:
> January 7, 1984, Chicago 
> Dear Philip: 
>
> I thought to do some good by giving an interview to People, which was exceedingly foolish of me. I asked Aaron [Asher] to tell you that the Good Intentions Paving Company had fucked up again. The young interviewer turned my opinions inside out, cut out the praises and made it all sound like disavowal, denunciation and excommunication. Well, we’re both used to this kind of thing, and beyond shock. In agreeing to take the call and make a statement I was simply muddle-headed. But if I had been interviewed by an angel for the Seraphim and Cherubim Weekly I'd have said, as I actually did say to the crooked little slut, that you were one of our very best and most interesting writers. I would have added that I was greatly stimulated and entertained by your last novel ["Zuckerman Unbound"], and that of course after three decades I understood perfectly well what you were saying about the writer’s trade—how could I not understand, or miss suffering the same pains. Still our diagrams are different, and the briefest description of the differences would be that you seem to have accepted the Freudian explanation: A writer is motivated by his desire for fame, money and sexual opportunities. Whereas I have never taken this trinity of motives seriously. But this is an explanatory note and I don't intend to make a rabbinic occasion of it. Please accept my regrets and apologies, also my best wishes. I'm afraid there’s nothing we can do about the journalists; we can only hope that they will die off as the deerflies do towards the end of August.

!!! "" lyrics
	> and cry for no good reason  
	> at the Eastering sky.
	
"Eastering" could have two meanings here: as an adjective, "eastering" is defined as "that is moving eastward", but it could also be the adjectival form of the noun, "Eastering",  meaning "the action or practice of celebrating Easter" (OED).

!!! "" lyrics
	> Well I saw straightaway  
	> that the lay was steep,  
	> but I fell for you, honey,  
	> easy as falling asleep.

"Lay" is another tricky one, and could be a combination of two senses, firstly as in the idiomatic phrase, 'the lay of the land', and secondly as in the slang for a partner in, or instance of, sexual intercourse.

## Allusions to other songs ##

!!! "" lyrics
	> It had a nice ring to it,  
	> when the old opry house rang  
	> so, with a solemn *auld lang*  
	> *syne*, sealed, delivered,  
	> I sang.
	
This is a pun on two well-known songs: "Auld Lang Syne", originally a poem by Robert Burns, and "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours" by Stevie Wonder.

!!! "" lyrics
	> you ranged real hot and real cold,  
	> but I'm sold.  
	> I am at home on that range.

These later lines could be meant to evoke the country standard, "Home on the Range". Its status as a 'cowboy song' gives lends a resonance to the phrase "dead or alive" heard earlier in the song, and often seen on the stereotypical Wild West bounty notice. Newsom manages here to evoke three distinct meanings of 'range': the limits between which something varies; a large area of open land for grazing or hunting; and a large cooking stove with several burners or hotplates (OED). 

## Show business ##

!!! "" lyrics
	> Twenty miles left to the show.  
	> Hello, my old country. Hello.  
	> Stars are just beginning to appear,  
	> and I have never, in my life,  
	> before been here.

Although this song does not mention Lola Montez (see ["Have One On Me"]({filename}haveoneonme.md)), the narrator does many of the same things as she: see the references to "the show", to dancing ("step, ball-change and a-pirouette"), and to singing (the "old opry house" discussed above). In light of the lines from ["Baby Birch"]({filename}babybirch.md), "Do you remember staring, / up at the stars, / so far away in their bulletproof cars?", it is tempting to read the same dual meaning in the "stars" that appear at the start of this song.
