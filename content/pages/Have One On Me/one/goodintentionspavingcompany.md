Title: Good Intentions Paving Company
Release: Have One On Me

With its references to dancing, showbiz and travelling far from home, this song was perhaps, like "Have One On Me", inspired by the story of Lola Montez.

# Annotations #

The title of the song is a riff on the proverb, "the road to hell is paved with good intentions".
"Eastering" could have two meanings here: as an adjective, "eastering" is defined as "that is moving eastward", but it could also be the adjectival form of the noun, "Eastering",  meaning "the action or practice of celebrating Easter" (OED).

!!! "" lyrics
	> It had a nice ring to it,  
	> when the old opry house rang  
	> so, with a solemn *auld lang*  
	> *syne*, sealed, delivered,  
	> I sang.
	
This is a pun on two well-known songs: "Auld Lang Syne", originally a poem by Robert Burns, and "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours" by Stevie Wonder.
