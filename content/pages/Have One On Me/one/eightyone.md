Release: Have One On Me

# Annotations #

This song contains several references to the biblical garden of Eden and the associated concept of original sin. It also has specifically Christian references: to St George, patron saint of England, and the mention of "the year of A.D. 1" (which, incidentally, is a pun on the title of the song).

Newsom mentioned original sin in relation to fame in an interview for Bomb Magazine:

> **...Careers live and die on the whims of record company executives.**

> Or else quietly limp along on the tolerant arm of a weirdo indie label! But either way, I do think the phenomenon of notoriety, on any level -- even the tiniest, briefest little flicker of fame -- carries with it a touch of original sin, that shame of witnessing your own exposedness, seeing your appearance as it’s seen by the rest of the world. Right now we’re deep in a shit storm of new, uncontainable, un-chartable ethnographic data concerning the surging pervasiveness of the Internet, the perception of self, and the validation of the soul. And we’re still many years away from a moment that’s historically quiet enough for anyone to comb through and begin making sense of it all.
