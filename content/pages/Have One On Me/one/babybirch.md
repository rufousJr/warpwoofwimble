Title: Baby Birch
Release: Have One On Me

# Annotations #

This song has often been interpreted as covering themes of pregnancy and motherhood, a reading perhaps inspired in part by the phrase "rabbit test", which began as the common name for a pregnancy test in the 1930s but later became a euphemism for pregnancy tests in general.

## Showbusiness ##

!!! "" lyrics
> Do you remember staring,  
> up at the stars,  
> so far away in their bulletproof cars?

These lines make a pun from two definitions of 'star': a glowing point in the night sky; and a famous or talented entertainer. Later, the narrator "sees stars and reels": here, the meaning is of feeling faint or dizzy.

## Engine breaks ##

!!! "" lyrics
> We heard the rushing, slow intake  
> of the dark, dark water,  
> and the engine breaks,

Much ink has been spilled in debating the correct reading of these lines, especially whether or not "engine breaks" is a misspelling of "engine brakes". Personally, I understand the words as referring to the technique of 'engine braking' used to slow heavy automobiles. However, "breaks" could be a colloquialism for "breakages", or a conflation with the idomatic phrase, "them's the breaks".

## Children's rhymes ##

!!! "" lyrics
> *And, if I should die before I wake,*  
> *will you keep an eye on Baby Birch?*

This is probably a borrowing from the children's prayer known as "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep":

> Now I lay me down to sleep,  
> I pray the Lord my soul to keep,  
> If I should die before I wake,  
> I pray the Lord my soul to take.

!!! "" lyrics
> told her, "wherever you go,  
> little runaway bunny,  
> I will find you."  
> And then she ran,  
> as they're liable to do.

*The Runaway Bunny* is a children's story book detailing the devotion of a mother rabbit to her offspring; the speech in the lines is a paraphrase of the mother's refrain.

> Once there was a little bunny who wanted to run away. So he said to his mother, "I am running away."  
> "If you run away," said his mother, "I will run after you.  For you are my little bunny."

 The introduction of the of "blacksmith", "shepherd", "butcher-boy", and "barber" further evokes tropes of children's rhyme and fairytale (for example, the butcher, the baker and the candle-stick maker of "Rub-A-Dub-Dub"). With this in mind, the "goose" earlier in the song could be allied to Aesop's *Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs*.

On the other hand, the "butcher-boy" could be an appearance from the titular character of the traditional American folk song on the theme of the forsaken woman. In fact, the chord progression of this song is very similar to that of "The Butcher Boy".
