## Fantasy, fairytale and folklore ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> Not informed of the natural law,  
	> squatting, lordly, on a stool, in a stall,  
	> we spun gold clear out of straw.

There are two possible references to fairytales in the song. The line "I have slept for forty years" evokes *Sleeping Beauty* (and *Rip van Winkle*), while the lines quoted above are a clear reference to *Rumpelstiltskin*.

!!! lyrics ""
	> and woke to find me gone.

To me, this line evokes the haunting fairytale related in Keats' poem, ["La Belle Dame Sans Merci"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/resources/learning/core-poems/detail/44475), whose eleventh stanza reads:

> I saw their starved lips in the gloam,  
> With horrid warning gaped wide,  
> And I awoke and found me here,  
> On the cold hillâ€™s side. 

In the song's final section, the subject is addressed as "pretty Johnny Appleseed", the American folk hero.

## Nabokov ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> And you, with your    
	> arrangement with 'Fate',  
	> nodded sadly at her lame assault  
	> on that steady old gate,  
	> her faultlessly etiolated fishbelly-face:  
	> the muzzle of a ghost.

The quoted lines share ground with Nabokov's novel, *Lolita*, which Newsom describes as an enduring influence on her work. One finds correspondence between Humbert Humbert's 'McFate' and the treatment of fate here -- in Nabokov's own afterword to the novel, he writes of needing to obtain "such local ingredients as would allow me to inject a modicum of "reality" (one of the few words which mean nothing without quotes) into the brew of individual fancy". Inasmuch as a single word can be described as Nabokovian, 'etiolated' is perhaps a candidate; indeed, it appears on p. 4 of *Lolita*, in the foreword, where it is used in a metaphorical sense to mean something like 'purged of overt eroticism'.
