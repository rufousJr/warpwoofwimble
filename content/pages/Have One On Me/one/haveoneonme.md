Title: Have One On Me
Release: Have One On Me

According to Newsom, the instrumental part of this song was written "on a big old beautiful grand piano in the Sear Sound studio, in New York, while Jim O'Rourke was observing his monastic session of solitary *Ys* mixing, and I was waiting to be let back in the room."[^amsong]

In the lyrics booklet, the text of a significant number of lines are italicised, which might aid some listeners in their appreciation of the narrative.

# Annotations #

## Lola Montez ##

The song is largely a series of allusions to the life of dancer and courtesan Lola Montez.[^bio] Newsom has long found interest in Montez:

> **You grew up in Nevada City, California, a small Gold Rush town.**
>
> It's a really, really strange town. Basically every building there has been there since the Gold Rush. There's still stages around that had a lot of Gold Rush-era performers come through, people like Lola Montez and Lala Crabtree and Mark Twain. There's miles of boarded-up mines and tunnels. And in downtown Nevada City, there's a network of tunnels that had to do with a system of brothels that existed during the Gold Rush. I worked in a coffeehouse downtown, which was located right above this hive of little tunnels, and it was definitely haunted. Pretty much everyone who worked there would see the ghosts of Gold Rush whores. I'm convinced I saw one.[^arthur]

In fact, the city of Grass Valley, where Newsom was born (and indeed is the location of Station to Station, the recording studio where some of *Have One On Me* was laid down), was the residence of Lola Montez between 1853 and 1855. Her house remains a California Historical Landmark.

> This record deals a lot with the idea of home and hometown. People have described me as being so informed by the nature and the magic of this place. I think on this album I’m exploring that -- I’m working through that idea. There’s a lot of mythologizing of Nevada City as this utopian magical hippieland.[^nyt]

## As title track ##

Newsom expressed some thoughts on the song's title and its position as the title track of *Have One On Me* in an interview with *The Quietus* entitled ["A Vision of Decadence"](http://thequietus.com/articles/04232-joanna-newsom-have-one-on-me-interview).

> **The title of the album is so immediate, but you can read it in lots of different ways. Was that intentional? And if so, what are you trying to say with that title?**
>
> Well, on one level there was a tonal decision to choosing the title that has a relationship with the tone of the record. ... And then the title is meant to point at the title track as the sort of central thematic message of the record. ...
> 
> It also refers to a kind of self-sacrifice that is a theme in a lot of the songs. It's a very feminine thing as well. It's the giving of yourself in those drinking terms, like pouring something from a bottle, and the level of the wine goes down and down and down with each glass that you pour and hand out. And it relates to the title track because that's sort of essentially what I saw in Lola Montez's life: this constant wandering and diminishment of the self through the giving of the self, through performing, and just as the myth grew, the self shrunk until she just died poverty stricken and alone with pneumonia, being cared for by Jesuit priests that she hated. And having these affairs with these incredibly important powerful men, none of who took care of her. The way women were, and the way women are in that sense, is fundamental.

## Billy Joel ##

!!! lyrics ""
    > Bottle of white, bottle of red.

Jody Rosen, for the *New York Times*, wrote, "[Newsom] calls *Have One on Me*... her 'early '70s California singer-songwriter album,' citing influences like Joni Mitchell's *For the Roses* and Graham Nash's *Songs for Beginners*."[^nyt] It has been suggested that this song bears resemblance to the 1977 Billy Joel song, "Scenes from an Italian Restaurant".

## Religion ##

Newsom uses several religious cliches and Biblical stock phrases throughout the narration. Whereas the Biblical book of Matthew is explicitly mentioned in ["Jackrabbits"]({filename}..\two\jackrabbits.md), consciously or no, Matthew's words are also used in this song.

!!! lyrics ""
    > "In your heart is all that you need;  
    > ask and you will receive," it is said.

The quotation marks and the declaration that 'it is said' implies that Newsom is imitating devout Christians' habits of quoting scripture with a similar idiom. "Ask and you will receive" is a saying of Jesus' found in Matthew 7:7:

> **7** "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.  
> **8** "For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened."

Slightly earlier, in Matthew 6:19-21, Jesus says:

> **19** "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.  
> **20** "but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and thieves do not break in and steal.  
> **21** "For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
