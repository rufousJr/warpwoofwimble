!!! lyrics ""
	> who will harvest what we have sewn

Assuming that it isn't a misprint, the use of "sewn" in place of "sown" deserves to be noted.

!!! lyrics ""
	> pluck every last daisy clean,  
	> till only I may love you.
	
This image probably refers to the traditional "loves me, loves me not" game played by an anxious lover.

!!! lyrics ""
	> Sit, and see how the fog,
	> from the port in the bay,
	> lays like snow
	> at the foot of the roanoke:

This perhaps places the "river" mentioned in the song as the southwestern US Roanoke River. What this insight adds to the song I am not sure.

!!! lyrics ""
	> hear the frog, going courting  
	> till the day he croaks,

Perhaps an allusion to the traditional song, "Frog Went a-Courtin'". As a reassurance that this site is nowhere near the most niche on the Internet, I would recommend [David Highland's website](http://home.earthlink.net/~highying/froggy/froggy.html) containing over 170 verses of the song.

!!! lyrics ""
	> All the livelong day,

Perhaps an allusion to another traditional song, "I've Been Working on the Railroad".

!!! lyrics ""
	> But, like a Bloody Mary,  
	> seen in the mirror:  
	> speak my name  
	> and I appear.
	
The Bloody Mary is a figure in folklore and ghost stories, who behaves as described in the song.
