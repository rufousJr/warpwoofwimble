# Content #

The album articles draw together quotes from interviews and information from liner notes. They might help the reader come across novel interviews, or just learn a bit more about the album.

The song annotations are intended to be conservative, commonly-cited interpretations. I wish to make clear that many of the annotations are not original; rather, each song's page represents a collation of many people's analyses, which I have simply drawn together (albeit before adding a few thoughts of my own). However, the reader should bear in mind that the annotations are ultimately written by one person and constitute a subjective, and therefore debatable, intepretation of the songs.
