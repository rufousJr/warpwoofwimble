# Content #

The album articles draw together quotes from interviews and information from liner notes. They might help the reader come across novel interviews, or just learn a bit more about the album.

The song annotations are kept quite conservative, focussing largely on well-accepted interpretation. However, the reader should bear in mind that the annotations are written by one person and constitute a subjective, and therefore debatable, intepretation of the songs.
