# Content #

* *About the album articles*:
    these articles aim to draw together quotes from interviews and information from liner notes. They might help the reader come across novel interviews, or just learn a bit more about the album than you can find elsewhere on the internet. Some of the articles might make it to Wikipedia later on.

* *About the annotations*:
    the interpretation of song lyrics can range from looking up words in a dictionary to inferring minor themes of the song that are based on both the lyrics and the opinion of the interpreter. My notes aim for the middle of this range; that is, context for the lyrics that is harder to discover than word definitions but is still as objective as possible.
