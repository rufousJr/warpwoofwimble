The mentions of moths throughout the lyrics associate the subject of this song with the genus of moths called *Cosmia*. A moth is likely the framed creature in the *Ys* cover painting.

As related in *Arthur*:

> *Towards the end of high school, when she was eighteen, Newsom went down alone to a wild spot along the river. After asking their assistance, she arranged some stones into a circle, and then sat down within the ring. She stayed in the circle for three days, fasting, facing the river. Her best friend and some pals camped a few miles away, bringing her water and small portions of rice while she slept. She had assigned herself things to do but abandoned them all. She just sat there and watched the river, and, even more, she listened to it.*[^arthur]
