# Introduction #

The definitive overview of this album is Arthur magazine's piece, ["Nearer the Heart of Things": Erik Davis profiles Joanna Newsom](https://arthurmag.com/2006/12/23/nearer-the-heart-of-things-erik-davis-on-joanna-newsom-from-arthur-no-25winter-02006/). "[Newsom] spoke at length with *Arthur* partly because, besides the fact that she actually reads the rag, she hopes to lay certain matters to rest and be done with them." That said, if you want even more after reading that piece, some of the interviews excerpted below might be of interest.

Over the years, Newsom has continued to answer interview questions about this album. Looking back on her collaboration with Van Dyke Parks ten years later, she said

>  [Parks] has a record called *Song Cycle* [that] he wrote when he was twenty-two, and wrote it in part to cope with some sorrow and loss -- and I wrote [*Ys*] under similar circumstances at the same age. [...] As the years have passed, I've realised what a unique working arrangement I had with Van Dyke. I don't think it's his normal working arrangement. I don't know why he decided to consent to my particular way of working. I just gave a lot of notes -- months and months and months of notes, back and forth and back and forth.[^eggers]

# Themes #

Newsom gave a summing-up of what she thought of as the themes of the album, saying, "I think of it as a very pastoral record, really. It's farmlands and harvests and livestock. It's an album about loss, but much of the imagery has to do with fecundity."[^guardian]

# Conception #

Newsom considered the production of the album to be "very formalised", a quality which was "a ballast to a lot of the brutal or unhinged emotional material that I was working with."[^quietus]

>**You've said for *Ys*, you pored over every syllable before it was finished.**
>
>Well, I was in a mathematical frame of mind, I think. Not real math, but intuitive math -- a kind of idle, self-soothing impulse, like making sure all three Dixie cups have the same number of dry pinto beans in them. That impulse didn't govern the meanings of the songs, or the spirit of the record, but somehow I needed it -- I needed that syntactic hyper-vigilance, to act as a mill through which all those songs had to pass in order for the record to find itself.[^ussongwriter]

# Influences #

On the subject of general influences for the album, Newsom said:

> I obsess over structure but I don't think about it in the context of anyone else's work, especially with this project. I don't even know what to compare it to. The only thing I was influenced by on some level, in storytelling I guess, was *The Sound and the Fury*, by [William] Faulkner.[^1]

The annotations for individual songs examine how they were influenced by Faulkner and another Newsom favourite, Vladimir Nabokov.

## Title ##

The title is pronounced like "ease". It comes from a myth (retold in the [Arthur piece][arthur]) contained in a book described as a favourite of a close friend of Newsom "for whom many parts of [the] record were written".[^wire] In Pitchfork, Newsom said:

> [The title] was the last thing that I chose, after all the songs and the cover art were finished. So none of the songs directly allude to that myth. But the main themes that emerge out of that myth are really close to the themes on the record --- mortality, decadence, an excess of water, isolation, rebirth.[^pitchfork]

# Artwork #

The cover art was composed with egg-tempera and oil by Benjamin Vierling. The Milkymoon fan forums published an [interview with Vierling]({filename}../interviews/vierling.md), extracted here:

> We worked together to arrange the composition of the painting, and her input was indispensable. I would have been unable to evoke such subtle complexity without her influence. She brought a lot of thematic influence to the image, and through her enthusiasm I felt compelled to challenge my abilities as a painter. To identify the symbolic meaning behind the imagery, one would have to ask Joanna herself. My goal as a painter is to invoke the spirit of a Thing - be it an object an animal or a human- through my rendering of it, and thus I am not a 'Symbolist' in the literal sense because I believe that the image should speak for itself. Any and all secrets are there for the finding. One need only to look to discover...

The original painting now resides in the permanent collection of Newsom and her husband.[^vier-blog]

The design is credited in the liner notes to Rich and Andrea Good (Rich being Newsom's former bandmate in The Pleased). The creator of the etchings in the liner notes I suppose is one of them too, though they could as easily be from some old book. (Please contact me if you know!)
