# Introduction #

The definitive overview of this album is Arthur magazine's piece, ["Nearer the Heart of Things": Erik Davis profiles Joanna Newsom][arthur]. "[Newsom] spoke at length with *Arthur* partly because, besides the fact that she actually reads the rag, she hopes to lay certain matters to rest and be done with them." That said, if you want even more after reading that piece, some of the interviews excerpted below might be of interest.

# Themes #

> **Could she elaborate on this over-arching story? I have tried and failed to discern it.**

> Well, last time round, everything I said was taken really literally and I don't want that to happen again. I'll just say that I think of it as a very pastoral record, really. It's farmlands and harvests and livestock. It's an album about loss, but much of the imagery has to do with fecundity.[^guardian]

# Influences #

> I obsess over structure but I don't think about it in the context of anyone else's work, especially with this project. I don't even know what to compare it to. The only thing I was influenced by on some level, in storytelling I guess, was *The Sound and the Fury*, by Faulkner.[^1]

## Title ##

> [The title] was the last thing that I chose, after all the songs and the cover art were finished. So none of the songs directly allude to that myth. But the main themes that emerge out of that myth are really close to the themes on the record-- mortality, decadence, an excess of water, isolation, rebirth.[^pitchfork]

> **You mentioned about the interest in pagan stories, where does that interest come from?**

> It comes in part as a nod to the friend for whom many parts of this record were written, who I can't talk about very much. But I basically did some reading and studying specifically, I guess, in honour of her - I don't particularly like that expression but I don't know a better one. Sorry to be so cryptic![^wire]

# Artwork #

The cover art was composed with egg-tempera and oil by Benjamin Vierling. The Milkymoon fan forums published an [interview with Vierling]({filename}vierling.md).

> We worked together to arrange the composition of the painting, and her input was indispensable. I would have been unable to evoke such subtle complexity without her influence. She brought allot of thematic influence to the image, and through her enthusiasm I felt compelled to challenge my abilities as a painter. To identify the symbolic meaning behind the imagery, one would have to ask Joanna herself. My goal as a painter is to invoke the spirit of a Thing - be it an object an animal or a human- through my rendering of it, and thus I am not a 'Symbolist' in the literal sense because I believe that the image should speak for itself. Any and all secrets are there for the finding. One need only to look to discover...

The original painting now resides in the permanent collection of Newsom and her husband.[^vier-blog]

The design is credited in the liner notes to Richard Good, possibly Newsom's former bandmate in The Pleased. Whether this is the case, and whether Good is the creator of the etchings in the liner notes, I do not know.
