Title: Monkey & Bear
Release: Ys

Newsom talked about this song at length in an interview with Wire Magazine:

>  In a way, the song is a surreal narrative that goes away from the story of the record ... I think the idea of performance in this song has more to do with the relationship between the monkey and the bear than anything else, like conditional love - the monkey's saying, if you just dance a little bit longer and if you keep those chains on, and if you keep that costume on, then under those conditions then I'll continue to love you. [^wire]

She has described the song as a "decadent journey" of "blind fumbling".[^berlinohsix]

# Annotations #

## Flora and fauna ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> What is now known by the sorrel and the roan?  
	> By the chesnut and the bay and the gelding gray?
	
Some of these words might signify flora, but in context they are primarily signifying the "loose" horses. (See, for example, the logo of the publisher of *Visions of Joanna Newsom*, Roan Press.) 'Founder' in this context also has a specific meaning relating to animal husbandry: a foundered animal is one disabled by excessive feeding.

The given name 'Ursula' comes as the diminutive of the Latin *ursa*, or she-bear. The 'Ursala' in the lyrics is clearly inspired by this.

## Religion ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> until we reach the open country,  
	> a-steeped in milk and honey
	>
	> ...
	>
	> bear shed the mantle of her  
	> diluvian shoulders
	
The phrase "a land of milk and honey" comes from *Exodus 33:3*, as a description of the Promised Land of the Israelites. The word 'diluvian' is sometimes used as an adjectival form of the Great Flood, described in *Genesis 7--8*.

## Idiom ##

!!!lyrics ""
	> "When the blackbirds hear tea whistling, they rise and clap.  
	> Their applause caws the kettle black.  
	> And we can't have none of *that*!  
	> Move along, Bear; there, there; that's that."

This verse makes a pun of the English idiom, "the pot calling the kettle black". Additionally, in ornithology, the word "kettle" signifies a group of birds circling in flight (see ["Make Hay"](){filename}.../Divers/makehay.md).
