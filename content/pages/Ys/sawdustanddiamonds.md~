> I think every song I write is just attempting to bring back this moment that I had when I was probably a year old. I had a dream about a huge cat and a huge dog wearing party hats, holding a big glass bowl of jelly beans and looking at each other in the eyes and being really silent. And they were standing at the top of these stairs and I swear that the stairs --- and I know this sounds ridiculous --- but in my dream, I woke up and I thought that I had seen eternity. I thought that I had actually visually seen what it looked like for something to not to end, you know?[^ebe]

!!! lyrics ""
	> Burro, buck and bray songs of long face.
	
As the joke goes, "A burro walks into a bar. The barman asks, 'Hey pal, why the long face?'"

## Allusions ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> It is terribly good to carry water and chop wood,

This might well be a borrowing of the proverb from Zen Buddhism, "chop wood, carry water."

!!! lyrics ""
	> Then I hear a noise from the hull,  
	> seven days out to sea.  
	> It is that damnable bell!  
	> And it tolls --- well, I believe that it tolls --- for me.  
	> It tolls for me.
	
This is likely inspired by the celebrated sermon by John Donne in *Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions*. It is put into excellent content in his [Poetry Foundation biography](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/john-donne).
