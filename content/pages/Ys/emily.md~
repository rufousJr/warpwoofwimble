	> ... Daylight failed  
	> Insensibly, and round us gently fell  
	> Composing darkness, with a quiet load  
	> Of full contentment, in a little Shed  
	> Disturbed, uneasy in itself as seemed,  
	> And wondering at its new inhabitants.

> The Emily in the song is my sister, who's an astrophysicist; the narrator is myself, who is not an astrophysicist. Emily is the wanderer; she lives in Argentina and sometimes New Zealand. I'm not a wanderer, which is funny because I'm on tour half the time.[^pitchfork]

## The earth ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> The meadowlark and the chim-choo-ree and the sparrow
	>
	> ...
	>
	> so the muddy mouths of baboons and sows, and the grouse, and the horse, and the hen
	
The meadowlark and the sparrow are birds that fit well in the pastoral aspect of this record. The chim-choo-ree is a Newsom coinage. Another 'odd-one-out' listing appears later, where the collection of several pastoral animals from the Northern Hemisphere is juxtaposed with the (African) baboon.

!!! lyrics ""
	> We've seen those mountains kneeling, felten and grey.
	>
	> ...
	>
	> In due time we will see the far buttes lit by a flare.
	
These could well be descriptions of the ranges of light-coloured mountains, such as the Sierra Nevada, found near Newsom's hometown.

!!! lyrics ""
	> Peonies nod in the breeze,  
	> and as they wetly bow  
	> with hydrocephalitic listlessness,  
	> ants mop up their brow.
	
Newsom expanded upon this sentence in an interview:

>**Well, "hydrocephalitic listlessness" has a different meaning to every person.**

>But it's also an image. It's supposed to be immediately accessible. It's supposed to mean having a head that's full of an excess of water. That's a flower. It's also an image of decadence and excessiveness and fertility and fecundity and laziness and all these things that have direct parallels to the story, the actual story, but also have a certain value as images.[^1]

## The heavens ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> though all I knew of the rote universe were those Pleiades, loosed in December,
	> 
	> ...
	> 
	> Pa pointed out to me, for the hudredth time tonight,  
	> the way the ladle leads to a dirt-red bullet of light.
	
The Pleiades, or Seven Sisters, is a star cluster contained in the constellation Taurus. It is generally visible in the Northern Hemisphere from late autumn through to early spring.

The Ladle, also called variously the Big Dipper, the Plough, and, properly, Ursa Major (the Great Bear), is perhaps the easiest constellation to find by sight, and as such is often used as an orientation point by stargazers. Many stars are "dirt-red", but the most famous is Betelgeuse. It is part of the constellation Orion, which is also easiest to see during winter.

!!! lyrics ""
	> ... the meteorite is the source of the light,  
	> And the meteor's just what we see;  
	> And the meteoroid is a stone that's devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee
	
One could argue that these definitions are muddled. Though a meteor is undoubtedly the "perceived" phenomenon often called a shooting star, the meteor*oid* is the debris that "causes the light", which might well burn up before its "bone" is "thrown from the void" into a museum to be labelled as a meteor*ite*.

## Religion ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> There is a rusty light on the pines tonight;  
	> sun pouring wine, lord, or marrow, down into the  
	> bones of the birches, the spires of the churches, jutting out from the shadows;
	>
	> ...
	> 
	> Told: take this.  
	> Eat this.
	
There are many spiritual turns of phrase in the song, and some Christian imagery. The Pharisees, important figures of Judeo-Christian history, and pharoahs, characters in texts of the Abhramic religions, make appearances in the first verse, and, in the quoted lines, the allusion is to the (Christian) sacrament of the Eucharist.
