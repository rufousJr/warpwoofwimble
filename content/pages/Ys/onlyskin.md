Title: Only Skin
Release: Ys

> **Most revealing, perhaps, is Newsom's admission that the last few verses of the song --- where the long-suffering female protagonist promises to do right by her darling -- are the only place in the whole album where she just made stuff up, where the song steps away from poetic autobiography.**

>I was hoping for a good resolution, but I felt helpless and foundering at the end. And so I reached for this fiction, because I didn't know how to end the song in full truth. Otherwise, it would go on forever.[^arthur]

According to Harp magazine, "for the song "Only Skin," [Newsom] told [Parks] she wanted to hear 'an elephant marching down the street really heavily (and) there was maybe a bird darting around its head and it was distracted by that.' How did that sound musically? Parks had to figure that out."[^harp]

## Flora ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> while yarrow, heather and hollyhock  
	> awkwardly molt along the shore.
	
The habitats of these three flowering plants are not usually littoral.

## Idiom ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> Well, what is this craziness?  
	> This crazy talking?  
	> You caught some small death  
	> when you were sleepwalking.
	
In this bedroom scene, a double-entendre might be intended with the expression from French, *la petite mort*.

## Allusions ##

!!! lyrics ""
	> But always up the mountainside you're clambering,  
	> groping blindly, hungry for anything;  
	> picking through your pocket linings ---  
	> well, what is this?  
	> Scrap of sassafras, eh Sisyphus?
	
Sisyphus is a character in Greek mythology condemned by the gods to futile labour, in cycles pushing a boulder to the top of the hill only for it to roll back down to the bottom. Later on, a sibyl, oracle of the ancient Greeks, is addressed.

!!! lyrics ""
	> Last week, our picture window  
	> produced a half-word,  
	> heavy and hollow,  
	> hit by a brown bird.
	
The image of a bird, here a finch, killed by collision with a window is reminiscent of the opening of the poem of *Pale Fire* by Vladimir Nabokov: "I was the shadow of the waxwing slain/ By the false azure in the windowpane;/ I was the smudge of ashen fluff --- and I/ Lived on, flew on, in the reflected sky."
(Two more parts of the song echo, to my ear, lines from the final canto of *Pale Fire*: the "dark dream" described at the start of the lyrics calls to mind the awakening from a dreamed sleepwalk relayed in lines 873--886; and lines 970--984 touch the themes of "Emily" and, indeed, the biographical nature of *Ys* overall --- with "I can't with certainty say we survived" echoing the couplet "I'm reasonably sure that we survive/And that my darling somewhere is alive".)

!!! lyrics ""
	> With your hands in your pockets,  
	> stubbily running  
	> to where I'm unfresh,  
	> underssed and yawning ---  
	
In Guardian piece examining the extent to which modern songwriters are inspired by literature, Newsom revealed her inspiration from *The Sound and the Fury* by William Faulkner.

> I filched ... characters that in my head had life to them, were so finely drawn that they became archetypal: Jason Compson in *The Sound and the Fury*, running with his hands in his pockets, foreshadowing greed and repression - he became a touchstone ... .[^guardianp]

!!! lyrics ""
	> When the bough breaks, what'll you make for me?  
	> *A little willow cabin to rest on your knee.*
	
Supported by the "baby" mentioned earlier in the lyrics, this couplet evokes the lullaby, "Rock-a-bye Baby": "Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop./ When the wind blows, the cradle will rock./ When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall,/ And down will come baby, cradle and all."
