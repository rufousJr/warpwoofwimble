Title: Reflections on and in "A Pin-light, Bent"

["A Pin-light, Bent"][] has the barest of arrangements of any song from *Divers*. In fact, it is the cycle's only solo: the only musician credited in the liner notes is Joanna Newsom, on harp and vocals, and the recording features none of that chorus of multiplied Newsoms heard elsewhere on the album. The song is a soliloquy, where a flight attendant mourns her slow rise and wonders at her slow fall, before she dies "anelectric and alone".

In that respect, the song is one of vulnerability. But it begins with an undeniable humour. Consider the first two stanzas (up to the line, "Poor flight attendant"): the lines, which are each a single sentence, are somewhere between terse and pithy. They have a dense rhyme scheme, where each line in a stanza rhymes and always with that *lie* sound as its second syllable. Such patterns bring to mind nonsense rhymes, not the elegy that the words' sense implies.

The parallelism of these lines further enhances the sense of irreverence: "My life comes and goes," in the first stanza (S1) changes in S2 to, "My life came and went," implying that the end of the narrator's existence is as inconsequential as changing two words in a song. The "short flight", which in S1 we take to be a trip by aeroplane, in S2 becomes a freefall. And perhaps the "rows" of S1 is a pun (on *rose*) made in contrast to the "descent" that takes its place in S2.

The repetitive, measured metre of the lyrics is reflected by the measured, repetitive harp accompaniment. In the first two stanzas, the harmony line is just two alternating notes, underlying which is a very simple bassline that serves barely to suggest the chord of the proceeding few bars. When the metre of the lyrics changes in S3, so too does the accompaniment, with arpeggiated chords heard in a rhythm working against the primary (musical) metre. The melody line becomes more drawn out. The lyrics remain repetitive, but in a different manner now, one that leads us less to look for wordplay and more to consider gravely every word that is sung.

!!! lyrics ""
	> But the sky, over the **ocean**!  
	> And the **ocean**, skirting the __*city*__!  
	> And the __*city*__, bright as a **garden**  
	> (when the **garden** woke to meet me),

However, this mood doesn't last long. After the first four lines of S3, the song returns to the pattern of the initial stanzas. The rhymes return (including rather contrived-sounding double rhymes this time: "honeycomb" with "funny homes" and "intersected" with "anelectric") and while there is no wordplay that I can see, there's still that word "funny", reminding us not to afford our narrator too much respect.

As a whole, the third stanza has, to my mind, the greatest resonance with the themes of the album. There is sky and sea ("Goose Eggs", "Divers"); there is a garden ("Anecdotes", "Waltz"); there is a city ("Sapokanikan", "Leaving the City", "Same Old Man"); altogether, there is the zoomed-out view of Earth from "My Heart Alive" (and indeed from Kim Keever's floral, submarine skyscapes that illustrate the album cover and liner notes); there is sightseeing and home; and, of course, there is light.

Elsewhere,[^3] it has been suggested that *Divers* follows a chiastic structure -- that is to say, a structure based on the figure of speech known as chiasmus, where the order the terms in the first of two parallel clauses is reversed in the second. Such a form encourages symmetry and recapitulation -- re-casting old ideas in new light.

One of the most beautiful examples of this form that I have come across in modern poetry, which also happens to be one of the most technically accomplished, is by Julia Copus, entitled ["The Back Seat of My Mother's Car"][]. It has a perhaps more refined form of symmetry than chiasmus and I would encourage you to read it before continuing.

In an introduction to the poem, Copus said:

> This whole poem takes place over a few seconds. ...
> It's written in a new form which I developed while
> I was writing my first book. The form is called
> 'Specular', after the Latin for a 'mirror' ... .
> Here the car window acts as a reflecting device
> in the middle of the poem.

In other words, the strength of the poem lies largely in the way Copus marries so naturally its "specular" form with the *verbal* reflector of "cool slick glass" mentioned at the point of inflexion.

***

One could argue that "A Pin-light, Bent" also has such an inflexion. If only there were one more (short-lined) verse at the end of the song! Then the rhymes, the metres and the dynamics would invert perfectly around the 2m:21s mark, at the melody's rest between "alone" and "in".[^2] Nevertheless, it's an interesting way to read the song. S4 introduces two delineating elements: firstly, the "fence", then, later on, the "mirror". These are, perhaps, hints at a specular structure -- like the "cool slick glass" of "My Mother's Car". (I've reproduced the "long metre" part below for comparison with the corresponding part of S3. By this analysis, the structure corresponds a mirror with Amora.)

!!! lyrics ""
	> from the Great Light that shines through a **pin**-hole,  
	> when the **pin**-light calls itself __*Selfhood*__,  
	> and the __*Selfhood*__ inverts on **a mirror**  
	> in an **Amora** Obscura.

Let us reflect again on the echoes of other parts of *Divers*. Earlier, I matched the view of Earth in S3 with that heard in "My Heart Alive", but I neglected to point out an important distinction: the latter song has the narrator ascending -- watching the pale blue dot get further and further away -- whereas here the direction is reversed: she is decidedly coming back down.

And the resonances I hear in S4 are with those less happy parts of the album than those in S3: there is a divide ("Waltz...", "Divers", the trenches of "Anecdotes"); there is attendance -- in the sense of waiting (the forgotten Twenty Thousand in "Sapokanikan", the women left waiting in "Waltz..." and "Divers", this song's unlucky narrator); there is cruel defenselessness ("Anecdotes", "Leaving the City", "...My Heart Alive"); even light is portrayed as an unfriendly juggernaught, (see, especially, "Leaving the City" and "Waltz"), and the final word of the stanza is "darkened".

S5 echoes, primarily, the first and second stanzas, in terms not only of its rhyme and structure but also its sentiment. The narrator talks again of her life, her death, and the small freedoms found between the two. Yet the tone has darkened; we aren't laughing any more.

We also find the song's final echo of "Anecdotes". This echo is stronger than the others, and is of a sort found often in *Divers*: namely, the call-and-response.

In "Anecdotes", the nightjar calls,

!!! lyrics ""
	> But, inasmuch as that light is loaned,  
	> and, insofar as we've borrowed bones,  
	> must every debt now be repaid  
	> in star-spotted, sickle-winged night raids?

And, in "A Pin-light, Bent", the flight attendant responds,

!!! lyrics ""
	> But it's mine. Or, at least, it's lent.  
	> And my life, until the time is spent  
	> is a pin-light bent.  
	> It's a pin-light, bent.

This would be a fitting way to end the album, yet I believe that the form of the song implies its consequent. As mentioned earlier, the structure indicates symmetry, but Newsom chooses to cut the natural conclusion, bringing to song to an abrupt end. We could, therefore, consider the next track as a continuation of the thoughts of "A Pin-light, Bent".

In terms of narrative, this song is notably similar to James Dickey's poem, "Falling", and, while their forms differ significantly, each has a distinctive structure that serves to inform the meaning of the work.[^4] Perhaps, like Dickey's air stewardess (who, during the ultimate freedom afforded by death, undresses as she falls), Newsom's narrator breaks free of the trammels of her origins to express herself -- "unmarked", "unmoored", and at last taken seriously -- in the following track.

[^2]: The layout of the lyrics in the *Divers* lyric booklet obscures the essential structure of the last three lines of S3, which are sung as four: "from that height was a honeycomb / made of light from those funny homes, / intersected: each enclosed, / anelectric and alone."

[^4]: Dickey: "I was interested in using the kind of time-telescoping effect that Bergson talks about in discussing the difference between clock time and lived time. It takes twenty minutes to read the poem, more or less. It surely wouldn’t have taken her nearly that long to fall. But as to how long it seemed to her, that’s quite a different thing."
