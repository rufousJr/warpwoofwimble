ADD MORE POINTING OUT OF PARALLELISM AND CHIASMUS

<i>Until now, my essays here have made their focus the main thematic motifs of *Divers*. This time, I make a close reading of "A Pin-light, Bent", as the first part of a series considering the form and structure of the penultimate, ultimate and first tracks of the album as well as each track's role as consecutive parts of the album's cycle.</i>

***

["A Pin-light, Bent"][] has the barest arrangement of any song from *Divers*. In fact, it is the cycle's only solo. The only musician credited in the liner notes is Joanna Newsom, on harp and vocals, and the recording features none of that chorus of multiplied Newsoms heard elsewhere. This fits the story in the song --- a flight attendant mourning her slow rise, wondering at her slow fall, before she dies alone.

So, a song of vulnerability? Perhaps. But there is an undeniable humour to it as well. Consider the first two stanzas (up to the line, "Poor flight attendant"). The lines, which are each a single sentence, are somewhere between terse and pithy. Rhymes are in abundance, with these stanzas following an AAAA BBBB scheme, and with that "lie" sound as the second syllable in every line. This isn't a respectful way to talk about one's life and death! So, we laugh.

Look at the wordplay too. "My life comes and goes," in the first stanza (S1) changes in S2 to, "My life came and went," thereby depicting the end of the narrator's life as something as simple as changing two words in a song. The "short flight", which in S1 we take to be an aeroplane flight, in S2 becomes a freefall. And perhaps the "rows" of S1 is a pun (rose) made in contrast to the "descent" that takes its place in S2.

The measured, repetitive meter of the lyrics is reflected by the repetitive, measured harp accompaniment. In the first two stanzas, the harmony line is just two alternating notes, underlying which is a very simple bassline that serves barely to suggest the chord of the following few bars. When the meter of the lyrics changes in S3, so too does the accompaniment, with arpeggiated chords heard in a rhythm working against the primary (musical) metre. The melody line becomes more drawn out. The lyrics stay repetitious, but in a different manner now, one that leads us less to look for wordplay and more to concentrate sincerely on each and every word being sung.

!!! "" lyrics
> But the sky, over the **ocean**!  
> And the **ocean**, skirting the __*city*__!  
> And the __*city*__, bright as a **garden**  
> (when the **garden** woke to meet me),

However, this mood doesn't last long, as after the first four lines of S3, the song returns to the pattern of the first two stanzas. The contrived rhymes return (including rather contrived-sounding double rhymes this time: "honeycomb" with "funny homes" and "intersected" with "anelectric") and while there is no wordplay, there's still that word "funny" to remind us not to afford our narrator too much respect.

As a whole, the third stanza has, in my mind, the greatest resonance with the themes of the album. There is sky and sea ("Goose Eggs", "Divers"); there is a garden ("Anecdotes", "Waltz[...]"); there is a city ("Sapokanikan", "Leaving the City", "Same Old Man"; put these together and you have the zoomed-out view of Earth from "[...]My Heart Alive" (and indeed Kim Keever's floral, submarine skyscapes that illustrate the cover and liner notes). There is sightseeing and home. And of course, there is light.[^1]

There's a rhetorical technique that Wikipedia calls chiasmus, which, in one sense, is defined as "a grammatical figure by which the order of words in one of two parallel clauses is inverted in the other." (OED) This technique can be expanded to the length of a poem or even an entire book. (Again, I would refer the reader to the Wikipedia page on chiastic structure, whence comes the little knowledge I have of this form.)

One of the most beautiful examples of this form that I have come across in poetry, which also happens to be one of the most technically pure examples, is Julia Copus' poem, ["The Back Seat of My Mother's Car"][]. It has a perhaps more refined form of symmetry than chiastic structure and I would encourage you to read it before continuing.

In an introduction to the poem, Copus said:

> This whole poem takes place over a few seconds. [...]
> It's written in a new form which I developed while
> I was writing my first book. The form is called
> 'Specular', after the Latin for a 'mirror', because
> the second half of the poem uses the same lines as
> the first, but in reverse order, as if the whole thing
> is looking back at itself in a mirror. Here the car
> window acts as a reflecting device in the middle
> of the poem. [...]

In other words, the strength of the poem lies largely in the way Copus marries so naturally its "specular" form with the thematic reflector of "cool slick glass" mentioned at the point of inflexion.

***

One could argue that "A Pin-light, Bent" also has such an inflexion. If only there were one more short-lined verse at the end of the song! Then the rhymes, the metres and the dynamics would invert perfectly around the 2m:21s mark, at the melody's rest between "alone" and "in".[^2] Nevertheless, it's an interesting way to read the song. S4 talks of division and mirrors -- perhaps *thematic* hints at the specular structure like the "cool slick glass" of "[...]My Mother's Car"? (I've reproduced the "long metre" part below for comparison with the corresponding part of S3.)

!!! "" lyrics
> from the Great **Light** that shines through a __*pin*__-hole,  
> when the __*pin*-light__ calls itself __*Selfhood*__,  
> and the __*Selfhood*__ inverts on a mirror  
> in an Amora Obscura.

Let us reflect again on the echoes of other parts of *Divers*. Earlier, I corresponded the view of Earth in S3 with that heard in "[...]My Heart Alive", but I neglected to point out an important distinction: the latter song has the narrator ascending, watching the pale blue dot get further and further away, whereas here she is decidedly coming back down.

S5 echoes, primarily, the first and second stanzas, in terms of course of its rhyme and structure, but also its sentiment. The narrator talks again, more seriously this time, of her life, her death, and the small freedoms found between the two. Yet also, we find the song's second echo of "Anecdotes". This echo is of the strongest sort, found often in *Divers*, namely the call-and-response variety.

In "Anecdotes", the nightjar calls,

!!! "" lyrics
> But, inasmuch as that light is loaned,  
> and, insofar as we've borrowed bones,  
> must every debt now be repaid  
> in star-spotted, sickle-winged night raids?

And the air hostess responds,

!!! "" lyrics
> But it's mine. Or, at least, it's lent.  
> And my life, until the time is spent  
> is a pin-light bent.  
> It's a pin-light, bent.

[^2]: The layout of the lyrics in the *Divers* lyric booklet obscures the essential structure of the last three lines of S3, which are sung as four: "from that height was a honeycomb / made of light from those funny homes, / intersected: each enclosed, / anelectric and alone."
