Title: Visions of Joanna: Mentally travelling through <i>Divers</i>

In circling around *Divers*, I seem to be getting further from its centre. Joanna Newsom apologises to James Joyce in the liner notes "for liberties taken", giving readers of a signpost to gyrating landmarks of early 20th-century such as *Finnegans Wake* (Joyce), *Pale Fire* (Vladimir Nabokov), and *A Vision* (W. B. Yeats). Yet the word often used to describe this concept of an artwork eating its tail, 'ouroboros', comes from ancient Greece -- it's been around for a while. Always has the concept of "endings make beginnings" been tied up in human thought with cataclysm and its prediction. For example, Yeats' poem, ["The Second Coming"][], is a reimagining of the return to Earth of Christ as predicted in the Gospel of Matthew. Then there is that oft-repeated George Santayana quotation: "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." (A thought visited, incidentally, by Newsom in "Goose Eggs".)

In one of her first major pieces of publicity,[^spin]
Newsom was compared to Emily Dickinson, that visionary poet whose work became unstuck in time[^unstuck] -- most of it only surfacing following her death, and some surfacing even now.[^10]
I was struck by the resemblance of *Divers* to a William Blake poem from *The Pickering Manuscript*, which, like Dickinson's writings, lay unknown to literature for sixty years. The poem is ["The Mental Traveller"][].

[^spin]: "And now, a less informed opinion" (Dave Eggers), Spin Magazine, Jun 2004. There's also this attribution from a early interview, [^ebe] which seems rather naive now but nonetheless was echoed by the "wide, white stairs" of "Sawdust & Diamonds" three years later:
> I think every song I write is just attempting to bring back this moment that I had when I was probably a year old. I had a dream about a huge cat and a huge dog wearing party hats, holding a big glass bowl of jelly beans and looking at each other in the eyes and being really silent. And they were standing at the top of these stairs and I swear that the stairs --- and I know this sounds ridiculous --- but in my dream, I woke up and I thought that I had seen eternity. I thought that I had actually visually seen what it looked like for something to not to end, you know?

 Blake recounts a disturbing, absurd tale of a land where "the Babe is born in joy / That was begotten in dire woe." Its inhabitants grow old then young again in an unending cycle, such that Blake concludes his story with the line, "And all is done as I have told." Gender seems to be important: Blake draws our attention to this notion through repetition in the first two lines, "I travel'd thro' a Land of Men, / A Land of Men and Women too." The two infants of the poem are distinguished by much more than their gender, however: the Boy sounds the more corporeal of the two and undergoes dreadful punishment before he escapes the clutches of his torturer and "binds her down for his delight." Conversely, the Female seems to be sprung of the Boy's "gems & gold / Which he by industry had got." As Newsom sang in "Sawdust & Diamonds", "I wasn't born of a whistle, or milked from a thistle at twilight. / No; I was all horns and thorns, sprung out fully-formed, knock-kneed and upright."

We might recall the lovers of ["Divers"][]. The diver "yokes the waves of this arid world" (Blake's "desart wild"), bringing back pearls and jewels, which he by industry had got. One jewel is worth two lives -- wife and child perhaps, the "Female babe [... sprung ...] of solid fire". Newsom highlights the importance of gender to the song through her repetition of "A woman is alive!" And just as the first infant is bound by the woman old, who is later bound in turn by the fully-formed boy, so the "divers, and the sailors, and the women on the pier"[^1] are bound by rules.

In this way, we could arrive at a rather circular reading of "Divers": after all, what goes down must come up. The narrator has a resigned character: "I know we must abide / each by the rules that bind us here / [...] / and the divers are not to blame / for the rift, spanning distant shores." Every thing is "infinite"; every night, her dream repeats. Eventually, she chooses to break this symmetry ("I'll ever hold my breath").

[^1]: A primary definition of 'pier' is a supporting masonry structure, whereas the "Woman Old / Nails [the babe] down upon a rock". Spooky!

"The Mental Traveller" is often considered as an allegory of society or religion, and indeed, while the second part of the poem continues the story of the infants, it also applies a similar narrative of circularity to civilisation in general, represented by dwellings and towns. Blake gives the impression of a domestic scene around lines 25-50, but eventually, "the Cottage fades before his sight, / The Garden & its lovely Charms."

Like ["Sapokanikan"][], this poem has an Ozymandian motivation.[^2] Where "Sapokanikan" has its "land lone and leveled / by some unrecorded and powerful hand", in the Traveller's land, the "Eye altering alters all; [...] And the flat Earth becomes a Ball."[^4] For a while, only desert is left, "till many a City there is Built, / and many a pleasant Shepherd's home." Newsom's song appears as an inversion of this pattern: it *begins* with a map -- flat, "sanded and beveled" -- and its images of soaring colonnades and aeroplanes are only temporary; the song ends with the declaration that "the city is gone". Blake's city is perpetually remembered, whereas Sapokanikan is perpetually forgotten.

[^2]: ["Ozymandias"][] (c.1818) in fact came *after* "The Mental Traveller" (c.1803), although Shelley would not have been aware of the latter since it was not published until 1863.

[^4]: It is interesting to note that the printed words to "Sapokanikan" have perhaps the highest incidence in *Divers* of that Zealous capitalisation of Important Words of which Newsom shares Blake's affinity.

But back to what first drew me to write this essay: the circularity of the poem. Blake illustrates the progression of his poem through the oscillating lifelines of his world's inhabitants, yet nothing is more disturbing than their first forms. One is sprung from fire, and is formed

!!! lyrics ""
	> [...] of solid fire  
	> And gems & gold, that none his hand  
	> Dares stretch to touch her Baby form,

When another is born,

!!! lyrics ""
	> Terror strikes thro' the region wide:  
	> [...]  
	> For who dare touch the frowning form,  
	> His arm is wither'd to its root;

In their way, these reactions are birth pains, of which the existence Newsom often reminds us in *Divers*. As Matthew wrote, "But woe to those who are pregnant and those who are nursing babies in those days!" (Matthew 24:19). In fact, "Sapokanikan" has a Babe of its own: that disguised "kid" recorded on canvas, overwritten, then revealed once more. And, since he was painted by Titian, he is now like Blake's infants: you can look, but please don't touch.

# Appendix: Some Blake-like aphorisms from *Divers* #

<!------------------------------------------------------>
|	Newsom					|	Blake					|
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|	When cruel birth debases, we forget.<br>When cruel death debases,<br>we believe it erases all the rest<br>that precedes.	|	Love seeketh only Self to please,<br>to bind another to Its delight,<br>Joys in another's loss of ease,<br>And builds a Hell in Heaven's despite |
|	A goose, alone, I suppose, can know the loneliness of geese.	|	A dog starv'd at his Master's Gate<br>Predicts the ruin of the State. |
|	The longer you live, the higher the rent.	|	The poor Man's Farthing is worth more<br>Than all the gold on Afric's shore. |
|	What's redacted must repeat.	|	The hours of folly are measur'd by the clock, but of wisdom no clock can measure. |
|	Time is a symptom of love.	|	Eternity is in love with the productions of time. |
|	Anecdotes cannot say what Time may do.	|	What is now proved was once only imagin'd. |
