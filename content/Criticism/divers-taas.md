So far, so formal. Let us now contrast that song with the following one. It differs from APLB in many ways, but it *opposes* it in three main ones, namely, in metre, in arrangement, and in structure.

Whereas I was able to identify a clear metre for the stanzas of APLB, this song cannot be classified in the same way. Especially from the part of the song between its start and the end of its second refrain (that is, until just before the line "Hardly seen, hardly felt---"), the words in the lyric booklet are reminiscent of free verse, with their repeated phrases and irregular line lengths --- sung, the rhymes become more apparent, but they are in odd places, as though they are inserted at random in the manner of a freestyle rap rather than being a way of anticipating the next line of the song. The irregularity of the vocal line is in marked contrast to the preceding song, and is arguably the most irregular of all the songs on the album.

Whereas I called the arrangement of ALPB the barest on the album, this song has undoubtedly the most lavish, featuring as it does several vocal lines, piano, drums, and an entire philharmonic orchestra. Only the piano and one vocal line are heard at the start of the song, with more and more instruments added over its course as the song's crescendo coincides with the album's end.

Finally, whereas I concluded the essay on APLB by suggesting that it had a highly symmetrical form, this song is highly linear. I would split it into three sections: the "free" section mentioned earlier; the relatively formal part between "hardly seen" and "reaping / joy of life."; and the "breakdown" section from "Joy! Again" to the end of the song. These are three very distinct forms that would not appear related at all were it not for the thematic and musical continuity throughout the song. Too, whereas I identified the dynamic of APLB as reaching crescendi in the middle while the start and end are equally quiet, this song clearly progresses from quiet to loud between start and end with very little inflexion or deviation from that steady increase.

This is the cycle's finale, so it is perhaps not surprising that Newsom chose to write it in a fashion that draws us inexorably towards its end. BUT WHY DID SHE MAKE aplb SYMMETRIC?
